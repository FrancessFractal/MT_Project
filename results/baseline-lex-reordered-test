WITWATS - German Subtitles version 1 05 ( 2010- 12- 07 09 : 15 : 
it could be that a strange Substanz , found of a man in Südwesten from Arkansas , part s a test the Government ? 
the question is erregt rund for a phenomenon called " Chemtrails " , this neuerdings big attention . 
they say the government versprüht Chemikalien about us to the weather to controI and to change . 
and they say , the ungewöhnlichen Kondensstreifen in heaven re in a Chemikalien- beladene " Chemtrails . " 
they say people , the government versprüht up there Chemikalien to the weather to change and to manipulieren ... ... and leave in there and see what you call this a " Chemtrail . " 
so , when I think there hinsehe and that Kondensstreifen are you tell me that Chemtrails are " " ? 
yes ! 
a Kondensstreifen aufgelöst himself had already . 
the Christina , that' s interesting . 
this subject interests so not just in this country , but also in the European countries ... ... actually the whole world . many people are interested in this subject ! 
Dave , you' ve mentioned that Klimaforscher and others , study believe that the atmosphere ... ... that she sure any sign of this , ominösen Komplotts would recognize . 
our journey started in San Diego , California , where met to tausende scientists , Ingenieure , political Entscheidungsträger and Journalisten ... ... to the " American Association for the Advancement of Science " - conference . ( AAAS=Amerik . company for wissenschaftl . 
one of the themes was the künstliche Beeinflussung of Erdklimas , called , " Geo- Engineering . " 
during the conference scientists about the " Plausibilität talked " the Durchführung weltweiter Klimaveränderungs- Projekte ... ... under the cloak " Verhinderung the Erderwärmung . " 
a theory that breite Akzeptanz enjoy slams sprühen of " ETWAS " in the atmosphere . 
when scientists been asked to already laufenden Aerosol - Sprühprogrammen , she erklärten ausdrücklich , that no derartigen Programme were umgesetzt ever . 
but oddly enough those theories entsprachen the same ... ... what people rund around the world say that happened already now . 
when I heard that the " American Association for the Advancement of Science is abgehalten " - conference here ... ... and s a large portion of the themes to Engineering Geo- ... I had come out . 
I had to be there . 
I had to hear what this big have to say Klimaveränderungs- scientists . 
... eingesetzt to the other question to " Chemtrails " and Wettermanipulationen ... ... already now without our knowledge . 
I' m here a personal see them , except that I worked even in Regierungsämtern ... ... in a high Ebenen at the White House and the Landesregierung . 
personally , I' d be there sooner skeptisch ... ... but to be honest with you . 
" you can' t know what you don' t know . " 
Chemtrails ! 
in the Internet they' il angegeben as evidence for erzeugt entgegenzuwirken that the government künstliche Wolken to the Erderwärmung . 
you claim that the American government verwendet with more Duldung the national government ... ... in Geheimen planes to Ballungszentren with ... ... Aluminium , Barium and Strontium to besprühen ... ... to the Bedürfnislosigkeit ( ! ) the people and as the Weltbevölkerung to your airspeed as indicated . 
I' m always a little skeptisch , because me , Appears to make the government say ... ... not capable , soetwas in a so big Umfang . 
that' s not rain is no time . 
believe Sie´s or not . 
Militärflugzeuge ( dt . " Düppel " = Radartäuschkörper versprühen in this Region , " Chaff " ! ) 
little Aluminiumteilchen , sometimes they are of the plastic or even metallbeschichtete Papierstücke ! 
you are to Radar- resist and obviously the trainieren the . 
so , they wouldn' t admit it , but I was many years Marinesoldat ... ... and tell them that easy . 
what' s happening . 
, Militärflugzeuge , some West Airforce base ... ... get in the atmosphere up and re Polyester- stripes come up out of the Key , some are a little breiter ... ... other once house from Fiberglas ummantelt with Aluminium . 
the Air Force kicks these things from her aircraft ... ... the then drop down , what a all day before sometimes . 
this is unweigerlich military or ... ... what goes on here ... ... the government the Air Force ... 
when they see such paragon ... ... you can be sure . 
off s something ! 
that is so little , fine , magnetische ... little stripes tiny- ... ... either from Aluminium ... 
it' s find out a offence , what' s really and don' t . 
but it from looks so ... if a lebensrettende Massnahme is this the Militärs . 
motive behind this " Verschwörungstheorie augenscheinliche " is : 
a Weltregierung ( Stimmengewirr : quiet in the hall ! 
order in the hall ! 
I can' t hear nothing . 
Mr Chairman ! 
I want this house versichern that stammen both than my Amtskollege the Gesundheitsminister ... ... an hour for correspondence to this subject my Ministerium have received , the different that this Verschwörungstheorie contains t ... ... a Körnchen truth and the beobachteten stripes the planes ... ... just from the Triebwerken . 
order ! ... ... and I think that a anschauliches example for the new Sprecherin the Labour party this is ... ... that she is out Verschwörungstheorien about the U. S. government . 
- order ! 
you call " Geo- Engineering . " 
fight the Erderwärmung by chemischen dust bring you in the atmosphere and so schädliche Strahlung in the space reflektiert . 
our Definition of " Geo- Engineering " is : 
bewusste , großflächige procedures in the ( Klima - : system the earth . 
a Bandbreite of plans to Klimaveränderung was diskutiert . 
a klassisches instance s the Einbringung of reflektierenden particles in the Erdumlaufbahn . 
on the other hand , it could give think sometimes some good reasons about Aluminium . 
it out , himself , that Stratosphäre a lot of work over the Umweltverträglichkeit of Aluminium in the . 
the big thing is that a 4- even bigger Volumenstrom in little Partikeln has Aluminium than sulfur . . . . . . ... ... and that means that we have a 4- even d surface for the same Strahlungsantrieb . 
we have a about 16- fach kleineren Koagulationsfaktor ... ( Partikelverlust through Zusammenschluß too great P. / time ) ... ... and the a Verminderung bewirkt really . 
it from looks like auskommen if we with a geringeren Mengen . 
and the reason why the speech s in the Hughes Aircraft Patenten out of the year 1989 ... ... of Aluminium is . 
and that' s why we' il find Aluminium in Wasserproben , they were on to the surface . 
and here we have David Keith ... ... who says Aluminium a 4- even bigger Strahlungsantrieb did . 
so , they want that we do , here it is about sulfur , but ... ... they have verplappert himself and rausgelassen ... ... that Aluminium 4- s even better to reach for their targets ... ... and it from looks so when they were not that we know the effects whose . 
that little picture here s make some of a study about Nanopartikel - Fertigung the show , that you qualitativ very hochwertige s ... what a plane very simple ... ... qualitativ hochwertige Aluminiumpartikel , just by Aluminiumdampf sprüht oxidiert you , the . 
so it' s backing possible and there' s already a breite Literatur , the was busy , so . 
and you can do it , by killing either new planes is or the bestehenden umrüstet ... 
well , there' s a couple of ideas ... 
you to ask at a Technologie- company , if can umsetzen you ... ... and she won' t say it' s very complicated . 
they' il tell you : yes , we can do this . 
it from looks like Klimaveränderung through Aerosole ( Sprühpartikel ) s so cheap , ... ... that expenses t even il be a subject . 
it off of the Umsetzung are a lot of a Risiko- risk decision . 
to do the risks to do it to the risk t know . 
and it' s the problem , how we verwalten that grundlegend harder and different than else . 
well , I told you , it is to get cheap Stoffe in the Stratosphäre and I' m convinced that that' s right . 
I don' t think that this is changing . 
but I think the more weiterforschen the less just we' il make this thing ... ... the complicated the effects il look for the Umwelt . 
that' s it ! 
because right now it from s too easy . 
so , I think if we forschen more s il probably find out that it' s harder and komplizierter than we thought ... ... and that the Nebenwirkungen are to managen harder . 
and the a healthy no , that' il do it Management easier . 
of course , is the gegenteilige reaction possible . 
it' s gonna be a empirische ( =erfahrungsbasierte ) question , like people respond really when they find out that this plans . 
a different reaction would be example : 
if this , scientists re so worried about to little bubbles CO² in the atmosphere ... ... that would mean that in fact that we should auseinandersetzen us in with the risk of CO² in the atmosphere . 
and by the way , it' s not really a moral danger . 
it' s more like Trittbrettfahren on expenses of our times a grandma . 
... ... aktuelle Studien about the Luftqualität , u. a. from California Air Quality Resource Board of remember that stayed in little Partikel be especially For for the Atemwege . 
during the whole argument hear today , I don' t have Erwähnung about this Fall- out ... ... and the on a so hochreaktiven Metalls like Aluminium to Vergiftung of ground and Grundwasser s been ... ... and that . 
the question is , what the effects of Materialien on the human bless you were when they herunterkommen from the Stratosphäre ... ... in the special little Aluminiumpartikel . 
my elements of the Aerosol- study , people from the Carnegie Mellon university have checked the effects of the human health ... ... and though we have not veröffentlich , the first is this what do we have ... ... to berechnen to the Größenordnungen , not with pencil and paper ... ... but with a an expert for Gesundheitsauswirkungen on people , if this could be a subject . 
so , to Aluminium or else Partikel , there' s a lot of toxologischer aspects , of course , the to see you and right . 
but naturally , considering the enormen number of Partikeln and the Gesundheitsauswirkungen this little particles , the answer ... ... what we have it hasn' t been released yet , but the first s what we have here is to say - some führende an expert ... ... the epidemiologische research in to to health that that' s not even in the Ansatz a subject . 
let' s give me again , in the atmosphere 10 million tons Aluminium versprüht , no effects of the human bless you have ? 
you leave me here be careful . 
separate to examine your we the question of Giftigkeit ... ... so , we have begun first Aluminium and released yet nothing ! 
so , we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and released yet nothing ! 
we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and released yet nothing ! 
Dane saw in on and said , 
so , you tell me that the Versprühen had about 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... ... no effects of the human health ? 
he holte deep air , schluckte , and he said : 
be careful , you leave me here ... 
we have done no serious Studien to Aluminium , so it could be find that we in a dreadful thing , what we don' t have bethought . 
and the just so was for me , what is gelangen to the public . 
it' s the schädigenden Aluminium physics of the appear in the world be ! 
and here' s konfrontiert David Keith with right this subject and here he is , so if they had taken now the cat from the bag ! 
we have done no serious Studien to Aluminium , so it could be find that we in a dreadful thing , what we don' t have bethought . 
so they do it , because the evidence and the Agenda re separated from the try to prevent this Klimaerwärmung . 
obviously , there' s some other targets . 
if Bevölkerungsreduktion , control , Waffen- aspects , of course , Telekommunikation ... 
all möglichen things about the t we know genaues . 
we know it' s not really , and I don' t want mutmaßen too , what are that' s the targets ... ... but one we can recognise all right . 
these things are not ... These things are not vorteilhaft for humanity . 
it supporting the intention of Elite . 
so , I think the question' s , where we' re moving the Trennlinie between ... ... Aktivitäten , they' re don' t mind and no globale Aktivitäten , the a globale ... ... and benötigen on need . 
Dr. Holdren has explain to get yourself ready when president' s in terms science and technology and ... ... than director of the offices for science and technique - strategy ( OSTP ) available . 
I look forward to his Beirat in the coming years your betters 
my personal opinion is , we must leave Geo- Engineering on the table . 
we have to watch us the thing very carefully , because we' il be einzusetzen possibly desperate enough for it . 
what I will do when we were in the year 2040 or 2060 , a dramatic Klimakrise ? 
with we say ... ... weitreichenden Hungersnöten or Grünland that versinkt suddenly in the sea ... ... and the only annehmbare way we could start abzukühlen , the earth would be einbringen a direct surgery in the Klimasystem , beispielsweise by we Partikel in the Stratosphäre . 
of course we' il always have any things in the Stratosphäre . well , it' s not like that the Stratosphäre is untouched absolutely . 
but we don' t want off that any other people . and do the things a big Strahlungsantrieb have ... ... or einbringen about a longer Zeitraum big Mengen to reaktionsfreudigem material ... ... what could have a erheblichen of damage on the Ozonschicht to follow . 
you know , maybe I a take Partikel in the atmosphere because I' m trying to make a living with money . or I' il take a Partikel in the atmosphere to scientific research to an and to try to understand the Wolken- physics ... ... I take a Partikel in the atmosphere because I' m trying to rain in definite Regionen to leave it ... ... and the Wolken to impfen and so more time to our Schipisten to do . 
and that many questions on kicks of course . it' s üblicherweise risikoreich . 
it' s probably on some people have a negativen Effekt ... ... but we could find them us in a situation in the get it on auszahlt to take these risks us . 
one of the things that were all in shock me really was the match the Vorteile and risks this Programme . 
so , the Vorteile : 
an element was that Abkühlen of the planet . 
some of the called risks were Ozonloch , droughts in Africa and Asia . 
I can tell you this : 
after I' ve been listening four days that scientists . for four days Symposium ... ... I' m worried to rechtfertigen really , because s all right , rechtfertigen that them , rationalisieren and try ... ... a few really , really terrible effects , more Auswirklungen to our Umwelt . 
and formulieren basically the Verkaufsstrategie , the Umsetzungs and administration ... ... and the Finanzierungsstrategie . 
go to San Diego I was to write it all in shock of this Programmen that I was determined to me about it . 
after the Fertigstellung of Artikels in the night , I sendete angefügt this one Internet- magazine , with my Emailadresse . 
the next morning my Email- Posteingang was überschwemmt with Rückmeldungen of the world . 
why ? 
because I' ve mentioned Aluminium in context with Geo- Engineering- Modellen ... ... and then didn' t know that so many people are information about it . 
now , but it' s so , that metal il find - Aluminium - in big Mengen , far beyond more normal values , everywhere in the rain , ground and snow . 
in the follow calls of people a strömten , they were someone desperate , recherchiert the this . 
that' s the tip- off of was for that movie . 
before we started to filmen , we had to meet find out the opportunity with one of our geschätztesten Autoren and Dokumentarier , G Edward Griffin ... ... for what he knew about the subject . 
I want to speak a minute about a subject , this always more attention , pull on yourself . 
he this subject , that' s exactly scientific " Stratospherisches Aerosol Geo- Engineering " mean , " Chemtrail " - phenomenon . 
it' s these Kontroverse Chemtrail against Contrail ( Kondensstreifen ) very well wisdom . 
as I have befasst me so , a klarer case is that . 
I' ve been watching the Entwicklungen of Flugzeug- Verkehrs since his frühesten days . 
I wohnte in the corner of Flughafens in Los Angeles . 
I can remember me to the first Jets , the rape there . 
boy , what they did for a noise . 
as a noise had experienced we never before . 
we were often the end of Landebahn and this Jets to all saw her rape and abhoben ... ... because a new experience that for us . 
I' ve been watching planes my whole life and I know what are Kondensstreifen . 
I' ve been watching her . 
you house from verdampfter Feuchtigkeit , re Eiskristalle that sucks in the atmosphere ... ... and shine soon then , verdampfen and get out how can see you . 
a plane is followed by ... from a little white line right behind it ... ... and it about 10 or 20 Flugzeuglängen behind it is missing him ! 
by the way , can you keep an eye on these , too today from time to time . 
" there' s a Kondensstreifen ! " 
, these other things , talk about the here we are not at all the same phenomenon . 
those planes over fly and this white smoke out little bubbles ... ... the all the sky of Horizont until Horizont covers and s not at all auflöst ! 
the question is : 
why ? 
I have my own Vermutungen , but I hope that a couple of good investigative Journalisten go out and get us the answer . 
I know all the thing herauskommt , if - and she will tell - the people will do that undoubtedly . 
" yeah , well ... we' ve done it for EUCH , guys ! " 
" it' s for the good of the Allgemeinheit ! " 
" it is to prevent for the company . " free to the Klimaerwärmung . 
to impfen or maybe at the people against an attack with irgendeiner terrible Biowaffe . 
" we can yes rumlaufen not and in every an injection in the arm , but we can save them besprühen , and so their life ! 
you don' t see how good we' re ! 
" we do it for the good of the society . " 
I know what it is always , they' il say it' s for your own good ... ... and mine . 
setting up before . 
if we had to that the way , a Hurrican and a s in , New Orleans , Louisiana to meet . 
and we on , we could take him like that , that he' s got instead , Mississippi ... ... where I' d kill to save so instead of a hundred ... ... more or less 18 from Mississippi , at first 800 of New Orleans , Louisiana . 
and if you do that , aim you got there , this 100 men would murder you then ? 
here , there' s a whole lot of Rechtsfragen . 
it from looks so ... if it' s appearing Sprühen mostly in NATO countries . 
I have seen it here in the U. S. , Marvin , I' ve seen it in England , I' ve seen it to Scotland ... 
I have seen it here in Canada , and I' m reports of people from France . 
there are a Gruppierung . 
any political Gruppierung - of globalem amount . 
it' s not just an American phenomenon . 
it' s international and I think that should berücksichtigen anybody who would like to examine your this , that a fact . 
you' il find a political Gruppierung and a POLITISCHES motive . 
but my bescheidene mind hierzu : 
it' s no way to your or my health . 
I don' t know what it is , but we' il soon find out it ! 
I' m sure if you' il find the old Ratschlag " follow the money " folgst ... ... you sooner or later , the answer . 
we have noticed quickly that we had to issue the same need this information . 
teilhaben let the public , people know what will have done this . 
Edward was a touch of this thing like that he has suggested to help us . 
so , after the just so seems secured the Budget ... ... it' s fertigzukriegen the deal now . 
and that we can do to have not without any answers . 
we' re not scientists . 
we ask genaugenommen just questions . 
and we will be very skeptisch with the answers . 
it' s eyes on the point . 
why people SEHEN t you ? 
you listen , it' s not . 
you know , it' s not . 
you' il get the facts not on the table . 
you know , we got big luck ! 
look , us here in my lap which way is like it . 
( laughs ) ... way ! 
- yes , actually ... 
- yeah ! 
- it' s going to be a fight ! 
- a Herausforderung and a fight . but why we' re here ? 
- you' re now on ... 
- all right ! 
I saw the sky with a Zick- Zack- paragon of Chemtrails ! 
I don' t know any more if in L. A. or on the street , but I saw in heaven ... ... and thought . 
look at the on ! 
the Flugrouten re never ! 
that was a Gitter ! 
a Gitter ! 
a regelrechtes Gitter over the city and I traute my eyes . 
- milchig , white Wolken ! 
now from s all very einleuchtend . 
we have proof the Bodenproben with the Aluminium , Barium , Strontium ... ... and what can we read in the Patenten and what the Klima- Ingenieure say what' s gonna happen . 
for the Normalbürger a Volltreffer s it ! 
this a heikler wait for the herrschenden Mächte is . 
because she a verdeckte operation like the " Troposphärische Aerosol program , " or " Chemtrails " ... ... project " Ikarus " or whatever . 
it was a name in the of the years . 
and she rather it around in a public , science Klimaveränderungs- Sonnen- shield , because the Klimaerwärmung s from the rudder . 
so , right now the belly of the beast s just about us without schützende armour . 
I don' t care if the people believe in Chemtrails or not , the Klimamanipulations- thing should be frightful enough . 
and if people about Geo- Engineering know the truth , re obviously , Chemtrails ... ... because it' s DASSELBE ! 
so , we' re talking about a WELTWEITE plot ? 
Klima- scientists have suggested to make the world . 
we' re on our way to Redding , California . 
that' s the second step to the AAAS- conference . 
we' il see what I can find . 
we' re here in northern California at the house of Dane Wigington . 
he has about 2, 000 morning country ( about 8 km² ) with a look at Lake Shasta . 
he' s telling me about the a challenge the they' re up here . 
we speak even with Dane . 
we' il see what' s going on his Grundstück . 
we' il see what he so durchmacht and he too what Maßnahmen scores , and the Testergebnisse the he did . 
well , I' m from the Energiewirtschaft . 
I got ' 80s worked in the first Sonnenkraftwerken of the country , in the frühern , ! 
my house was on the cover of the world biggest Magazins for erneuerbare Energien . 
so , this is my Background . 
my target is it , the public to alarmieren . 
a man of giftigem material s herab on us point . 
about five years ago our skies was üblicherweise blue and now he' s full of Striche and Schleier ... ... and practically NICHTS what do you see in the Horizont and buried a natural cloud ! 
it' s actually all Rückstände this Flugzeug- lines with , ausbreiten up in Wolken , künstliche Wolken ... 
from the sky looks like a dirty ! 
no more white Wolken and blauer heaven , how have a few years ago . 
there it looks like with huge Industrieaktivität or at Waldbränden . 
we' il see that typischerweise every night . 
even in Bodennähe the clarity is reduced clear ... ... we don' t know bedecken that , except at the days of which we have these long , anhaltenden stripes ... ... ausdehnen up and all the sky . 
in some days can even see you how these lines with abfallen there , like a Schleier . 
we to take that the particles absenken himself . . . . . . and we have the tests , will show the that we überschwemmt with Mengen to Aluminiumpartikel ... ... they' re literally putting zehntausende times higher than the ohnedies up angesetzten Grenzwerte . 
so , we see this is not about a geringe prozentuelle Erhöhung this giftigen substances . 
we talking about Mengen ... beispielsweise of the side of that mountain Mt . 
Shasta ... 
if you hinüberschwenken even there ... that a Wahrzeichen northern Kaliforniens , that as unberührtes Wasserreservoir s s . 
Aluminium - . . . . . . Shasta our Schneeprobe of a Hang of Mt was 61. 000 ppb . 
( parts which Billon=Teile a Milliarde=10- ³ ppm : . 
the gewöhnliches Schneewasser is . 
and the people drink this stuff , if they besteigen the mountain . 
and you think about it . 
Amtshandlung s ppb necessary off 1 , 000 . 
that' s 61- fach about the gesetzlichen Grenzwert and our climber drink this giftige water ... ... on Mount Shasta . 
Barium : 
eight- three , Strontium : 
383 
so in this summer , the people who bergsteigen drink giftiges water . 
in the morning , Grunde ! 
I don' t want to drink sure 61. 000 Mikrogramm a quart Aluminium . 
and again , we have already fache the pH- values in this country to the 10 to 12- see up and can prove that clearly . 
- any suspicions . 
we can prove that clearly , this Metalle were in the rain . 
we have mehrfache samples . 
Bakkalaureus the Naturwissenschaften , Internationale school for Forstwirtschaft in Missoula ... ... master in Zoologie , Spezialisierung on Wasserfauna ... ... thirty five years as Wildtier- Biologe for the US Forstverwaltung ... ... and before a couple of years Bodenschutz for the USDA Bodenschutz service . 
besides , I ran Botanik- Programme , grass - and Weideland- Programme ... ... and this still cut . 
the moment I do a lot of Beratungstätigkeit for Meistergärtner . 
when I have begun a garden ... in the year G ... ... that , pH balance was here between 5, 5 and 5, 6 . 
this is the old Bodengutachten is . 
you can look here , on this side ... ... my floor . 
here with investigation 125 , 126 ... ... that my house . 
and here , the Bodenreaktion ... pH supposed to lie between 4 . 5 and 6, 0 . 
and over here in the mud it' s tan even a little bit . 
here he' s just 6, 8 . 
and what' s this with the shoots in Ökosystemen ? 
out and see us these little ... ... things to the in the floor so , dig one of those things we herumkrabbeln . many times they find you not even more ! 
those little Gliederfüßer , the can' t see you under the Mikroskop ... 
with the here , you can see the Bewegungen ... ... the little wee , mikroskopischen ... ... a little bewegende particles looks like . 
this gets to get out on ! 
to get out of here away re not totally , but she to start . 
this is Eicheln the Färbereiche ... 
here it is Zedernholz ... 
come on , guys ! 
this should be pH- mad and the Messung re expecting a higher than 10 fach worth ? 
something right here by terrific t ! 
- this whole reports to see you . 
a whole lot . 
- this 20 reports . 
two twenty . 
I' d say more to the 30 ... 
all dangerous Mengen show Aluminium ... ... and Barium ! 
the science says here to komisches something ... ... and say the whole Schwarzmaler : 
" so ? a neutraler is , pH balance not good ? " 
- no ! 
neutral s not good . 
neutral s not good . if your ground should have one , pH balance of 5, 6 , then he should stay there , if you want to have a healthy anti- forest . . . . . . and if you want to have a healthy anti- garden , you should your beibehalten , pH balance between 6, 0 and 6, 5 . 
I think it' s necessary that we wake up and see what' s happening ... ... because we' II ignore it can' t just because it' s getting worse every day and worse ... ... if we' II ignore it just keep on going and verdrängen and say : 
we had Einweckgläser , all the new , sterilisiert , in which the rain we have gesammelt . 
and we had a HEPA filter ( Schwebstofffilter ) with the air , we have getestet . 
okay , so you have gesammelt rain and gefiltert the air . 
what did you find ? 
Aluminium and Barium . 
here a test that has produce 375 000 ppb s still . 
Barium at three . 090 , Strontium with 345 . 
yes . this is about a doppelwandigen pond . 
with EPDM- Dichtungsbahnen for Fischzucht . 
( EPDM = it Ethylen- Propylen- Dien- Monomer- Kautschuk : there' s no Chemikalien or sonstige Stoffe in this Dichtungsbahnen , they could gelangen in the water . 
this poetry was developed for this use . 
the well , that was the pond speist getestet and getestet again . 
no Aluminium nachweisbar ! zero ! 
the only other source , they can speisen the pond s Regenwasser . 
we' re here on a gefilterten Waldanhöhe . 
meilenweit away from jeglicher industry , interstate or like that . 
for a few days , with heftiger Sprühaktivität we could see that a movie bildete up on the Wasseroberfläche . 
we have getestet this shift and the result : Aluminium and Barium ! 
after one and one- half years Ansammlung we had 375 000 ppb Aluminium in it . 
that' s literally putting giftig ! 
we can clearly , like in that what we see in heaven , the same , what is beschieben in diversen Patenten ... ... and the Stoffe in Erdreich stimmen with which the Patente agree . 
this Stoffe were 5 years not here ! 
in this Mengen a neuartiges phenomenon is that . 
in some occasions a Anstieg of 50, 000 percent , in case of Aluminium . 
from of the primordial Messung of 7 ppb up , what was ohnedies on up , for 50, 000 % in five years . 
we have seen tiefgreifende changes in this time . 
Dr. Lennard Thyme , doctor in really . I' ve done with him a Gegenprobe and he says that the Oxide of Aluminium , Barium and Strontium change that , pH balance ... ... from a sauren floor to a neutralen there , there' s no doubt . 
- and that' s just ... - well , what can keep an eye on you s right ! 
- oh ... 
I' ve got a Doktortitel in anorganischer really of the Oregon State University ... ... and worked with various Metallen and Oxidationszuständen . 
then I' ve done a postal Doktorat at the Brandeis university ... ... with the at the Stabilisierung the Oxidation assorted Metalle I worked . 
the target is find out what' s all this fügt in the dynamische the balance of life . 
I' ve worked with Francis up on Mount Shasta and he has way me some Regenwasser- analysis ... ... however ... ... that got to do with Aluminium - , Barium - and Strontium- Werten in the atmosphere . 
so , I think the wesentliche Giftstoff in this Chemtrails is that Aluminium . 
the values that we can watch on Mount Shasta re completely unacceptable ! 
if we speak of Metallen in germ Systemen , we are not talking about Aluminium Massenware of the people think ... ... if she use Dosenlimonaden and like that . 
if it' s übergegangen once in the Aluminiumoxid- condition it' s out front now a shift in the Blutgefäßen and SCHALTET the LEBEN AB ! 
will eingebracht if elements , they' re not generally in the Umwelt , for once in the neighbourhood , a few proper Alarmglocken bell . 
Aluminium s most awkward in germ Systemen . 
it' s hard , sit down , lets not go and the system off , nullifies - and war´s then ! 
by ansammelt you in the as time Aluminium it caused that' s quite neurologische damage ... ... because it' s ablagert himself than Aluminiumoxid there , it' il throw in principle there and dropped Over of normal system can' t be . 
the Gesundheitszustand of every man has to do always a man named Maß with Giftstoffen ... ... and Aluminium is known for krebserregende physics to do . 
the Halbwertszeit beträgt Jahrzehnte ! 
I think we should work too , okay einzubringen of this Giftstoffe from our Umwelt instead of more Gifte . 
it' s very bedenklich that we zuführen higher , if more Gifte , we the payments and the risks of cancer . 
it' s so sad that people anzurichten think about it , einzubringen in the Umwelt to bewerkstelligen Aluminium for something in danger and go bigger of damage . 
wherever this Stoffe come here , too , they' re here ! 
the on us herabregnenden Metalle t let bestreiten himself . 
that' s absolutely no Spekulation is ! 
say how already the Metallmengen have up himself in the last four years after the Tausendfache ... ... and the line for Luftqualität in California has examined the of China herüberkommenden Aerosole . 
... ... Mike , anzusprechen the reason why I was determined to me primär this subject is the because I keep everybody else themes for zweitrangig . 
what could have aufzusaugen Dringlichkeit a higher than t go to the door can ... ... and a Atemzug to get no air in Schwermetalle ? 
if our Böden il be poisoned , if our Gewässer poisoned ... ... what remains us , then left ? 
for what we s aufwenden too always our time and power ... ... whatever our political shot , this is a salvage basis for all of us . 
we need air the Atmen , the isn' t full of giftiger Chemikalien and Metalle . 
we need ablassen water , that' s not verseucht all about whatever those planes . 
people stopped trying to consider that our atmosphere is so thin , like a Farbschicht on a basketball . 
it' s an extremely thin shift , the possible life on this planet . 
you just as Physiklabor to mißbrauchen and that to experiment until she' s beyond any saving ... ... a stupidity of unglaublichem amount . 
go if people would understand that this kind of happen of forced ... ... not just JETZT , it' s been geraumer time . for 50 years has given it a lot of Klima - and weather - Veränderungs- Programme , entziehen the to the Kenntnis of Großteils public completely . 
and if they think that s not vote ... that she should have noticed kind of that soetwas ... ... I would ask them to make things like anzusehen " Agent Orange " ( Entlaubungsmittel in the Vietnam War : and other things the know this , because they have the power to be . 
because s no one here who she is . 
because they have these huge Militärmaschinerien , they want controI everything , and maybe ... maybe they' ve seen ... so that document the government ... ... verfügbar for jenen , the online in the Internet s whose name is " Owning the ( the property of the Wetters ) weather . " 
a erklärtes target our government . 
and not only our government . 
he' s mitgeteilt the Press Associated that the American government " techniques that has to Wetterveränderung " ... ... that it' s for the " new Weltordnung " possible , cold million Americans to leave and the rest to controI . 
to this Wettermanipulations- Methoden ... ... the entire Patente to gear 
not just that exist this ... ... but it also we have verwendet , Senator Clayborne Pell´s vollständige statement and his own Erzählung zurückreichend to the Vietnam War . 
- we shall do all we can . 
- will I see what we can do . 
you got the scientists behind you . 
scientists re with you , at least DIESER scientists s the matter with you ! 
- I don' t have a Millionen- Budget , but I have to show enough for that s going on something terrible wrong . 
- all right ! 
Arizona , then next Monday , the 21 . 
Senator Johnson to show Low . we' il be so long with the car on the way . 
- it' s a pleasure to meet you , ! 
- we love it here . 
it' s abgeschieden so , so calm and out peaceful . 
my name is Karen Johnson . 
I was 12 years in Parlament of Bundesstaates Arizona . 
I was 8 years in Repräsentantenhaus ... ... and four years in Senat . 
if a plane überfliegt ... ... and , uh ... ... from a end of the Horizonts the other the flick from the plane s enough ... ... and starts auszudehnen himself and wellenförmig more and more of the heavens to bedecken ... ... and to ausbreitet until it covers the whole Himmel ! 
how can do only one that would be normal as that ? 
and then beneath to live and to know that herabrieselt the - what it is always - in one ... ... and in the animals and on the ground ... ... so ... 
that' s frightful . 
and if people wake up , not really in the eye and the fact ahead ... ... that we have people make the terrible things with us ... ... and wake up soon and we' d fight back us , JETZT ! 
you know , I have 11 children . 
I' ve got five times a grandma . 
I have much to lose here ! 
I care what will keep for my kids left ! 
it' s just me and I' m very fond of me , what is left for her stay . 
Aluminium s giftig . 
besides , we know that it anhäuft himself . 
we know index that we always more about it . 
we in take it about the air , we have it with our water ... ... and we to take always more Mengen . 
so , the idea that more Aluminium s freigesetzt ... ... in our neighbourhood in the way it to describe how you have s very frightful ... ... and very verstörend for us . 
those who issued of us , the Untersuchungen have done that is very concerned about that the Allgemeinheit s on bad ... ... and at all about that will do this . 
Aluminium s giftig ! 
we know that . 
you can just about it , for the body what Giftmengen are schädigend , but ... ... ... that anhäuft himself ... ... anbetracht the fact is this erschwerend . 
the t worry about what will have expired it' s beyond the Meßgrenze ! 
why it' s don' t mind that we' re always besprüht in the entire United States - in the whole WELT ? 
who pays for that ? 
get so , the cases Alzheimer like a Mondrakete ... ... which has to do with the obvious Anhäufung of Aluminium in the Gehirnzellen . 
I think , in every family a member is to find that' s under Alzheimer . 
and it' s a horrible ... ... a terrible affliction . 
to say and : 
" it' s just because the people drink Limonaden from tins of . " 
you know my father died with Alzheimer and he' s never drunk Dosenlimonade . this explanation doesn' t sound very einleuchtend for me . 
and so I ask me : 
how very this Chemtrail- has geschädigt Sprühen , back in the neighbourhood of Illinois , him ? 
a friend of us for 20 or 30 years in Arizona , Feuerwehrmann Pine ... ... and he says that this Waldbrände , they are fight today , a heftiger have seen than , all she hardly . 
and if you looks at around the Luftmessungen and this little easy flammable Aluminiumpartikel ... ... and the Magnesium on the trees ... ... that never dagewesene Waldbrände causes . 
here you can see . 
you split a million are . 
there' s zugeschickt me that , and I' m awfully find it interesting because we should have just about two parts a million in our air . 
and it says here that we have 39 000 parts Aluminium . 
that' s a astronomischer value is ! 
the Barium- value is up ! 
well , that' s beyond of good and bad ... ... what can breathe the people right on it herabregnet . 
and the people wonder is that your health s adrift , and she' s in the Notaufnahmen have to . 
why they have Atembeschwerden ? 
why they get Alzheimer ? 
it was planned ! 
we have such Eliten ... 
I don' t know how you want to call her . 
" one- Worlders , " " Illuminati " what I know ... 
how do you always you call them . 
these people with t worry about the Durchschnittsbürger ! 
you see just about yourself , your greed , your power ... ... and if she eliminieren so 2/ 3 or 4/ five of us from this planet ... ... s fine for these people ! 
because , then they don' t have to see yourself more about soviele people herumzutreiben and to see . 
well , it' s a lot of the worum´s this is ! 
and it' s very , very alarmierend and frightful . 
so , where this stuff here comes ? ... and WARUM ? 
why a stuff il pass out that way out there ? 
so , I' ve heard so many explain . 
" yeah , we' ve got to cool the planet cool ... " and this and this ... ... but when people try the planet , why you need then such things in it ? 
the explain have geklungen never very authentic for me . 
when my Equipment I aufstellte them to saw me and said : 
" all the trees going to die ! " ... and I said : 
please ? 
you said : 
" all the trees going to die ! " 
well , I thought , well , I teste speak to Aluminium because it' s one of the Hauptsachen in this Programmen about the we here ... ... and Titan ... ... so , I took a sample of of a bark , and she ran a program test on the result was positive with Aluminium and Titan . 
and then I started in California herumzureisen , I bemerkte on all the same . 
in Lake Tahoe many Rinden were to find too the same sort , in the whole region from Sacramento , and Davis ... ... everywhere where I went , I bemerkte this silber- white bark . 
I think this Chemikalien a dringen in the floor and the roots destroy ... ... and then if they gelangen aufsteigen them in the bark of Baumes . 
these two over here , re just now . 
it hurts like that , watching like this ... ... look how old and big they are . 
we' ve lost probably 40 trees on our 10 morning country . 
, every week , every second weekend see a more tree , starts the to die . 
it' s just so sad . 
we cry just ! 
and remember that have to do anything that might the to think , together with the other explain ... ... would frustrieren me really dreadful ! 
always if a tree down to ... 
this is just not right . 
it' s just terrible ! 
and there is still a over there in this little Baumgruppe . 
it doesn' t feel better on in waking up and to fight , instead of into a little leak to crawl and sleep to go ? 
so ... GOTTES WILLEN , LEUTE UM ! 
your families s out there , your kids out there ... ... and your times a grandma ! 
I mean ... 
you MÜSST ETWAS TUN UM ZU HELFEN ! 
my greatest hope is to get people to Hinterfragen . . . . . . and if they not wake up , while we' re there , I hope pflanzen a few seed to do . 
we' re the most place of the planet . 
Hawaii ... ... at the store the things to see and data to provide . 
thank you , that plane before , you' re with us . 
however , we hope that you could get a chance to enjoy the trip . 
we wish you a great vacation or " welcome home , " if you' re living so happy here . 
the whole of the valley s autark . 
we have either Sonnen - , or Windenergie or Generatoren . 
- look at that ! 
- yeah , like a dream , you can' t even ausdenken himself . 
- that' s right . 
even if you come from becomes here , this paradise here just now s going to be destroyed . 
you make it to the " Insel- method . " 
you take it outside the sea , removed from the island . 
and so you' re the Chemtrail- planes t . 
the theory is that she and out to sea . 
- ... and so it in come to us ! - ... ... and KOMMT it HEREIN ! 
these here come from west . 
and she sprühen this also of both sides at once . 
a lot of the stuff this is really of the Chemtrails out of this way . 
il block off this Stoffe here ... ... they ! 
we should can see the Horizont ... ... there , where the earth krümmt himself . 
we' re up enough , we have the sea here , right ? 
we should can see " Big Island . " 
it' s just 30 miles away . 
and , as you can see , pull no blauer heaven is . 
that' s the key ! 
that' s all , you know , it' s this strange blue ... ... flute of blue what I call it . 
and that' s a nice day is now ! 
you know , there' s no blue sky more . 
we' il see us today , the stars . 
it' s like ... 
you' il see it . 
you can ZÄHLEN her ! 
so many nights to see stars are now ! 
there should be hunderttausende stars , and you can they ZÄHLEN ! 
one here , a there ... ... a Planet here , it' s like ... 
sometimes can see ZEHN you a hundred , in some other night just ! 
this is what worries me . 
this stuff here . 
- that' s quite WEICH is ! 
- okay ... 
you can abziehen it easy ! 
the bark ... ... that' s not of course ! 
I' ve seen hunderttausende Kokosnüsse , but never soetwas here ... ... she fall apart just ! 
you to see it , guys . 
soetwas I' ve seen never ! 
on " Big Island " I' ve always gepflegt the trees . 
something vergleichbares , how the here ve seen I never . 
and that' s besorgniserregend for me . 
no easy , the task you' re here on the island . 
I could see the Skepsis because it' s so beyond irgendeiner idea . 
it' s astonishing ! 
it' s trying to look amazing with the eyes of other . 
in my eyes , I see that ... ... it' s like day and night . 
other people about it ... 
the illusion s derartig tiefgreifend ! 
what wakes up do you think would happen if everybody and ... ... can understand what' s the matter , and what the plans ... ... that Klimaveränderer are ? 
I think ... I think it would make a real revolution that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
if people would understand really what will have expired here ... 
what are your Befürchtungen ... 
I know you love this country here ... 
what your Befürchtungen ... ... ... to Chemtrails are ? 
well , that we can' t live here anymore , and anpflanzen our own Lebensmittel ... ... and that our health will be affected . 
- you think that happened already ? 
- yeah ! 
the fact is that she' il do it every day ... every day . 
it' s a hämmern and hämmern and hämmern ... ... little tins of every day . 
and , of course , this only gets in the Umwelt . . . . . . and of course it schwächt the shoots . 
it needs a few years for it ... ... to schwächen ... to the shoots ... ... and then we ask for genveränderten Taro . 
then we ask for genveränderten Papaya ... ... because we can' t anbauen our natürlichen seed more ! 
so we got a future ! 
we can' t live to be really ... ... this so , how was created God us . 
so my friend has into this to make me a Haaranalyse of my daughter . 
well , I got a couple of hair of her Haaransatz , a few really new hair , taken away and eingeschickt . 
I was so sure that hair is unbelastet my daughter all , through the Lebensweise , the we have here ... ... and from there , it back came and their charts were really up with Aluminium . 
here the analysis . 
this is the Referenztabelle and here , the value my daughter is . 
23, 1 with Aluminium . 
heaven is covered with a white fog and if I aufsehe at night , I can' t see the long , deep stars more to think . . . . . . and I can' t different than me that has to do that thing with the health my daughter . 
I don' t know where this Schwermetalle should come here else . 
- look just like old she is . 
she was abgeschottet here . 
- here ! - and she' s ... 
everybody here d feel like : 
this is this paradise is ! 
- this child would be super- healthy as a horse ... 
- a ... ... place with biologischem Anbau ... 
- and here we have this whole Schwermetalle ! 
she has the höchsten chart at Aluminium ... ... and she' d no Impfung . 
friends , these people play God ! 
you play God and the weather manipulieren ... ... and she sprühen stuff in heaven ! 
you' re trying to change ALLES künstlich , and your shoots , trees and even the sea ! 
so , tonight we want you don' t mind that instead of to anfangt ... ... hope anzusehen you that . 
because I really think of my heart ... ... we' ve got a proper crisis . 
really ! 
you hurt me einzubringen in 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere obere . 
what causes Aluminium ? 
it' s gonna change that , pH balance of Bodens ... ... and that' s giftig for the Vegetation ! 
besides , it is very giftig for the human health ! 
they do it really ? 
tell me out of my Erfahrungen and what have we found . 
we have many have a lead , the let not only assume so ... ... but , like , I think prove that these things happen really . 
and like , this our all spezieller guest is I promise . 
Michael J. Murphy , currently taking a place that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
he' s working on a Dokumentarfilm with the title : 
" what in the world what are they spraying ? " ( in the world versprühen the there ? ] 
Michael . welcome on camera . 
great , today with you to speak ! 
the a friend from the other night ... ... he can see the things always from another Blickwinkel . 
he' s a little such a ... Verschwörungstheoretiker ... ... and he says , whenever okay , the president arrives to L. A. , there' s a whole week no Sprühen . 
have a better place for an interview ? 
look at that ! 
it' s really ! 
about our Farmen and stuff . 
so , basically they want unterbinden your ability to ... ... biological Lebensmittel to eat , clean Lebensmittel and bad water ... ... so kind of from s that for me that ... ... of course , it' s just a Prognose ... ... for me sounds the to KONTROLLE ! 
" how we controI the masses . " 
how can be Aluminium just kind of good for a ... 
what the second stuff you' ve mentioned was ? 
- Barium ... 
- Barium and Aluminium . 
they' re obviously giftig ... ... for ALLES ! 
for the human health ... ... for people for Farmen , for animals for ALLES ! 
- 61. 000 split a billion ... 
and behördlicher alarm should be at 1 , 000 ? 
at 1 , 000 ! 
and people drink this . 
the people who the mountain besteigen ... 
you drink this time . 
this is poison . 
oh , my God ! 
that' s obnoxious . 
- well , that 60. 000- s fach about the Grenzwert ? 
- that' s right . 
- 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ... 
I' ve spoken with friends in L. A. ... 
" oh , it' s just ice ! 
the Kondensation . " 
and I say : 
a Zweitklässler know , ice are not that and breitet so out ! 
you' re not expert , but a besorgter citizens , the said : 
" wait a minute , I want ... " 
you recherchierst and that' s what' s gotta do we do as an American citizen ... ... and say : 
" you know what ? 
I want to know what' s going on here ! " 
I want to know what the Lebensmittelbehörde s with my Lebensmitteln . 
I want to know what the government s with the air , the water , the floor ! 
it' s great , what you' re doing . 
my thanks to you , because you are light in this thing . 
the whole Theorien set aside . 
what will suggest the Klima- Ingenieure and found what is spooky enough ! 
so , we can beschränken anzusprechen us on , all this point . 
and I ermutige do more people vorzutreten and questions to ask you ... what he' s doing . 
thank you , Michael . thank you , thank you very much . 
Ausbringung of Aluminium- Aerosolen be affected everywhere . 
we have a magnificent , tropisches Klima , that' s how I believe in danger could be . 
so , we wanna come over here and I not only the news what people have found in the world ... ... but , people ermutigen to test even after Aluminium , Strontium and Barium . 
basically , I think it was a wirkungsvolle trip . 
I' ve seen wake up a lot of people here in Hawaii , in Maui , not just curious , but , weiterzuforschen gewillt . . . . . . and that' s my only option . 
I think that one of the mutigsten trains of Ed Griffin ... ... until now ! 
it' s the Tabu- subject of that no one should see ... ... and the Aerosol- Sprühungen are ! 
we have tonnenweise dokumentierte Nachweise about Aerosol- Sprühaktionen . 
' it to me ! that just Grundwesen of humanity was hinaufzusehen always in the sky and to ask : 
why ? 
no ! 
there' s no boundaries ! 
the room and the universe are endlos ! 
but now the 21st century we can' t do it any more ! 
... ... everybody , the aufsieht and the huge Gitternetze and the X- e the sky looks ... ... the not part of were till of a or two Jahrzehnten of our Daseins will explain aufeinmal for crazy ! 
and the people who the best and greatest Verfechter re the freedom ... ... don' t want that you talking about , because it could bring them in Misskredit ! 
it seems to melken as if there a whole Wirtschaftszweig s built ... ... to the Steuerzahler by a sort of weltweites Sprüh- s raised program ... ... for a lot of money with this project to scheffeln ... ... and it seems to see they don' t come on , what could have effects for this . 
you do not find out if the humanity can survive this or like that . 
you want to hinaufkriegen this stuff just there ... ... and DANN after we have gone to then this way , we ... ... that there' s companies , the on the fuck happened to Organismen profit ... ... seed , the fuck happened to Getreidesamen , they' ve changed ... ... to the Aluminium in the floor to resist getting . 
many Getreidearten grow not in such a area . 
so , after her up the Böden ... ... have to go to the peasants them ... ... and the seed buy that were changed to resist getting gentechnisch to the Aluminium , that was brought in the Böden . . . . . . and urplötzlich humanity is totally abhängig of this companies like Monsanto and other this huge Agrarkonzerne . 
you can' t anbauen even more natural seed . 
and we to watch it ! 
it' s a schockierende thing ! 
I hope we' ve gotta do not that , it' s true , but ... ... now indicates all on down ! 
we' ve got a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because H. A. A. R. P. [ high active Auroral Research Program ) could are also hiermit in context ... ... Geo- Engineering - like you' ve got angemerkt - that' s angeführt do in there' s a man named Dennis Kucinich´s Gesetzesvorlage ... ... the " space Preservation Act " often ... ... the last I heard , the Congress was not - that was nice of ya . 
and then Key Bail- out - how we call them here - Kay Bailey Hutchinson ... ... which has zusammengestellt to sit also a couple of law to Engineering Geo- in power ... ... something all of us , like , before the Klimaerwärmung to save me . 
it' s a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because they can pull in so many Aspekten good through ! 
- Ed , so they' re all , don´t you don' t ! 
- that' s it ! 
there' s this old proverb . 
" follow the money ! " , this will bring you üblicherweise the core of the Problems ... ... and for me out of it looks like here just a ungemein profitable industry s built ... ... rund about this concept " Geo- Engineering " or " Wettermanipulation " or " Reduzierung the Erderwärmung " ... ... and all the other things , the a ahnungslosen public can sell re pretty simple . 
" oh , that' s right . 
we want no Klimaerwärmung ... " ... and so they with do . 
and they don' t ask any questions , re not critical ... ... but in the Hinterzimmern you can see that an entire industry s built ... ... the way I say , ungeheuer profitabel is ... ... and ... ... all the money for it comes from the Steuerzahler ! 
it' s a cheating . 
basically , it' s it ! 
focus on that we and a subject , that' s very easy to prove : 
on this area there' s no Spekulation . 
you are definitely this Geo- through Engineering . 
you speak definitely about it . 
you work at the Methoden for it . 
you work for the Strategien out . 
you have the Budget for it . 
everything is in position . 
we need to lock anzusprechen aspects , of course not even to the case . 
well , people do believe her Theorien . 
but at least they have to understand that it is out of the question that will speak about it . 
so , they ought to do not as alarmiert be about what is scheduled ? 
it can be proven that a very destructive damage have this Barium and Aluminium and the other giftigen Metalle on the planet and the people . 
this isn' t good enough ? 
how many aspects , of course , we have to reinquetschen there ? 
well , if s planned to kill the planet and the population , we need to still there any other reason alarmiert to be ? 
" what in the world are they spraying ? " thank God , people that question ! 
we don' t want any more . 
we can only want to ask the questions . 
our good friend , G Edward Griffin . 
and Mike Murphy and Paul Wittenberger ... ... this great to do with your help . 
that' s a Gemeinschaftsanstrengung to get to RICHTIGE information to the people . 
" what in the world a few Abschlußworte spraying are they ? " still before our time for ? 
the Abschluß I betone nocheinmal that we have to put that question : 
" what in the world they spraying are ? " 
and now we WISSEN what it is . 
and people , it' s not like you ! 
I' m Peter Vereeke . 
I' m from Belgium . 
I' m 54th years old . 
I can' t believe it yourself . 
I' m a very happy and dankbarer man . 
we' il do the job , the police , that Justizministerium or the Umweltamt had to do . 
- and it' s very important that this is a Grassroots- revolution ( of the basis : . 
- I think so too . - because we fight t GEGEN , but FÜR ! 
- yes , we FÜR fight ! 
I was 25 years in the selectmen and a Legislaturperiode as mayor . 
from this moment - 10 years ago - himself had begun to change everything . 
I time to get to a picture of it , what will have expired really ! 
I was completely clear that we are fouled - humanity - ... ... keeps and ausgebeutet ... ... and the for centuries ! 
this Chemtrail- phenomenon made me mad because I was so helpless . 
you can you decide which Lebensmittel eat ... ... what you smoked , you drink ... ... which lives you what water live ... ... but not with this phenomenon . 
then you' re only a victim . 
it' s just a game . 
and give it to the good boys and the bad guys . 
and luckily , we' re in the spot the matter of good to play ... ... the ... the chance and the chance that Herausforderung have to überwinden . 
, the three days , the we teilten with them left jump my heart , because it' s living such a wonderful way . 
to live and so a ... restful way . 
at the departure well , I was wondering how it' s like there in 10 years . 
will destroy everything was on her Grundstück ? 
and if yeah , what' s his then their Lebensgrundlage ? 
you' il have to let himself zertifizieren of irgendeiner company XYZ ? 
and what would the Voraussetzungen for it ? 
this is the end of the freedom is then . 
that worries me very ! 
very ! 
I' ve learned here' s what to say . 
" everything was going so , what it' s like ... " " ... and everything will be all right ! " 
- it' il be all right . 
- everything' s going to be all right . 
- yeah ! 
I have this tiefe feeling that we will be the end victorious ... ... because we have the right on our side . 
the Kosmos help us ! 
and I have this strong sense , re supporting that we of Wesenheiten ... ... and of Mächten , the we can' t even meet us ! 
well , for the first time we' ve got to be the wissenschaftlichen record ... ... that we besprüht WIRKLICH . 
we' il besprüht ! 
it' s unbelievable and hard vorstellbar ... ... but we' re besprüht ! 
I think stehenzubleiben , at this point , s no OPTION ! 
if you know it once , and this a tool like to do and a chance like this ... ... that this Chemtrails- thing or persistente Flugzeug- Kondensstreifen or , as usual , you want to call it ... ... that this phenomenon s recognized than REAL ! 
in a public Debatte ! 
in the context with Geo- Engineering it is to get five- vor- Zwölf , the to the public . 
it was like the sky . 
the old paintings are . 
we have forgotten it , I' m afraid . 
in those years in that a journalist in the Medizinforschung tätig I was ... ... I' ve seen many , many things . 
what I always have checked I found always the same three aspects , of course . 
we' re done dümmer ... ... we' re done sick ... ... and we' re done unfruchtbar . 
people from the world at or around this time ... ... down here in Belgium the first International Chemtrails- Symposium . 
this one has to discuss führende Fachkräfte , hergeführt politicians and Aktivisten ... ... to Gesundheits - , Umwelt - and social aspects , of course this Programme . 
it' s all around here today ... ... with the full facts , Goodspeed , documents , numbers , Patente , Lizenzen ... ... all us leads to the truth . 
we don' t have any other weapon against these huge Komplex ... ... than that Aufdecken this düsteren works in Lichte the truth . 
however , we hope recognise that through our Anstrengungen more and more people the fact ... ... that we' re geführt of our Führern hinters light . 
we' re zusammengekommen today than family ... ... to join to show for our powers, with the people came here for the world , that no Verschwörungs- theory ... ... but a Verschwörungs- TATSACHE are Chemtrails ! 
from the Technischen university Delft in Holland ... ... ladies and gentlemen , please you and : 
Coen Vermeeren ! 
my name is Coen Vermeeren . 
I' m Professor at the Technischen university Delft . 
üblicherweise dimensionalen room have the people their heads in the sand ... ... in her own zwei- and see t upstairs . 
if they do this , but they' re gonna recognise any more and more room like this . 
it' s me , too . was he playing ? 
I have can give my students no explanation for this Phänomene . 
so I have myself examined her ... and had in that I could give them no answer . 
because I think that this phenomenon s not NATÜRLICH . 
what' s happening s not NATÜRLICH . 
and the explain the us were given re not zufriedenstellend for me . 
betrachtet you to explain anything from the wissenschaftlichen tone of he' s trying to first step something . 
I' m smart , my students re not quite so smart ... ... so I had to deliver them answers . 
but , if she put the most scientists an honest question , have to admit that that they' re not on all the answers . 
if Klima- Manipulation durchführt somebody over our heads , and I want to know that ! I want to know the consequences . 
I want to know the Gesundheitsrisiken . 
I want to know all about it . 
when teacher at my university have to deliver me the job my students answers . 
and they have good questions ... ... on the any answers I have ... 
- ... and I wanna know ! 
- fantastic ! 
and we should just about it . 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
for you here in Auditorium and for the world . 
Michael Murphy . 
thank you , thank you very much . 
it' s to be a great honor , here in Belgium . 
people at the power controI all ! 
they controI the Märkte , they controI us ... ... and now they controI even the weather ! 
and she can use it for kriegerische sole purpose . 
what she can' t controI ... ... the only s what did profit God . 
and that natürliches , biological Saatgut is . 
the name is " hierfür Hegels Dialektik . " 
problem - reaction - solution ( to Hegel : 
- Antithese - Synthese ) These 
the problem here are huge Mengen Aluminium . 
everything begins abzusterben . 
the solution to come from company X , they said : 
" hey , guys ! 
your shoots re not Erträge ! " 
" all die ! " 
" but we have the solution . 
we have Saatgut , it is also in such terms . " 
" the only issue is ... 
now you must get to MIR ! " 
we' re fond of me , that could be a part of this Agenda , all of course , and a biologic s abzutöten ... ... and to change on ! ... with genmanipuliertem Saatgut , it' s against Aluminium resistent . 
how do some maybe we just got back of a week Filmdreh in Hawaii ... ... it was an incredible trip . 
people there are very worried because she keep an eye on that their Kokosnussbäume re sick . 
her Besorgnis is that this Programme could be a part of a great Agenda ... ... for all Natürliche , Organische to destroy . 
that the Großkonzerne her only Nahrungsquelle re in the end genveränderte Lebensmittel . 
I didn' t expect that so many people , young and old ... ... on this phenomenon be interested ... ... and re worried about it . 
especially me s like the safety of the young girl today ... ... only 17 and haltend on a speech of audience . 
that' s incredible ! 
my name is Sophia Xenidis . 
I' m 5 years old . 
it' s to know creepy that the air , breathe the we , not that' s how it should be . 
that the Lebensmittel that we eat , carries the water we drink , tracks this substances ... ... the versprüht of us will be as if we were insects ! 
the feelings in the me auslöst are tiefe feelings of anger and rage ! 
I don' t want to be poisoned ! 
I don' t want to be with krebserregenden infiziert Stoffen . 
it makes me so angry , that world- Vergiften is , in a so gigantischen amount , always keep ... ... and not enough s done to gebieten to this crime Einhalt . 
a klare answer to a question : 
we' il besprüht ? 
we were besprüht ? 
and it' s too besprühen their purpose us always on ? 
what we' re gonna do about it ? 
- we' re with it ? 
how we will stop it ? 
I know the answer to my question ! 
there' s only one person that can stop it and you know who this is ! 
you BIST ES ! 
you BIST ES ! 
the person on the you' ve been waiting for . 
we' re great , wonderful , divine being ! 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
sisters and brothers in the Auditorium and in the world ... 
thank you , thank you very much , that you were here with us here ! 
and now , enjoy yourself with this song ! 
hello ! 
good to see you ! 
in come on ! 
anyway , I' m glad you good weather were till now . 
you to pretend , we do in the winter . 
if you go to Washington , you could land on the snow . 
- thank God , we don' t do that ! 
- that' s right . 
you know , this with this weather - Veränderungsprogrammen it' s strange . 
I guess it' s as about 32 alone in the American Festland ! 
so , the theory s that got to do with Geo- Engineering too on something Wetter- Manipulation . 
that' s an interesting point , Mike ! 
it' s connected soviele Untergruppen with this subject Geo- Engineering . 
people us my orders are to contact the whole time ... ... with information to close with Klimaerwärmung , connections with Wettermanipulation ... 
some people think you are , there' s a connection to the Morgellons- illness , at all . 
other again think it' s around a approach to transmission of elektro- magnetic Impulsen ... ... of H. A. A. R. P. Antennensystems up in Alaska and Sibirien . 
there' s one of the head of to humming comes and every issue of seems to be an investigation worth ... ... but we have so little time . 
I think it' s smart for us , that we' il concentrate our efforts to the Sprühprogramme ... ... and the Giftigkeit this Chemikalien , and the destruction of the planet and the Gesundheitsschäden ! 
what we need to convince more than the to the people that we must stop that ? 
so , I think focus it' s important that we us on it . 
Jeremy , we had there an idea . 
we know that you know the political system really good . 
the idea is following : 
we have here tonnenweise data and information , the we have gesammelt on the transportation . 
we lock to believe anzusprechen , a nice way that movie , this subject is ... ... gewählten deputy and politicians . 
so , we have asked us here' s what . 
if you could come and help us there ... ... and may show us how we can do that on the political level . 
that sounds like a good idea ... ... and I' m gonna look at me with what people off best we talk about it . 
if we' re gonna make it at least ... ... it for her impossible to make to say that they know nothing about ... ... and their way to take , abzustreiten a Kenntnis the Sachlage , the hindeutet on Geo- Engineering ... ... and on already laufende Aerosol- Sprühprogramme . 
at least it should be off to let s interesting , the " District the Kriminalität " ... with a few people Warnglocken . 
you have a lot of enemies to Washington . 
there bündelt up the whole power ... ... and the money . 
well , there it is safe people who don' t want you make this job . 
but I' m glad you' il ... ... you' il see what' s wrong . 
we were taking the facts to Washington DC , where we put the gewählten Regierungsvertretern next letter . 
according to the fifth Zusatzartikel the Constitution ... ... the United States of America ... ... one person life ... ... with or estate may be taken away without a tight Gerichtsverfahren . 
the täglichen Sprühaktionen but , entziehen ALLEN Bürgern the Vereinigen States life , health , freedom and Unversehrtheit ... ... without vorheriges , tight Gerichtsverfahren . 
... ... than Repräsentant the people of the United States of America house to protect we want her to do it in her power air , for us , and to erwirken a sofortigen Stop that Geo- Engineering Sprühungen ! 
it exist no Rechtfertigung , not il be legal still in other way , the planet and his people to poison . 
we gonna do us , Außerirdische come on the ground , maybe she down to land at the United Nations headquarters or maybe you choose a klügeren place ... ... anyway , we to take to land she and a school give us . 
and this school has two Drehknöpfe : 
with a button can you that the temperature on the ground ... ... and with the second button the CO² Konzentration . 
you can take that we would meet you know about this box wars ... ... because we have to some no way to us where we sit down the regulator . 
no Weltordnungspolitik . . . . . . and different people have different come true , where they want to have the regulator . 
Sonneneinstrahlungs- Manipulation s like Chemotherapie : 
nobody they want ! 
but we all want to get another chance for the other side got it to make and her risks to understand ... ... we should be to suffer in the situation of a dangerous cancer . 
- how long does it take up there ? 
- years , a couple of years ... 
- and then what ? 
it' s raining down ? 
- yeah , that' s correct . 
- don' t schädlichen Nebenwirkungen , of which she know ? 
- what we ask that our always Unbekannte of we don' t know is . 
- I understand . 
if they think of Versauerung , it' s no problem . 
there' s some Studien , the belegen that . 
but here' s the concern of course , that with that little research ... ... ... maybe a s not familiar - us - Unbekanntes out of the blue , and makes us . 
my name is Mike Murphy . 
I' m Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we hear a subject with the name " Geo- Engineering . " 
we had a fast question the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
I' m afraid I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
we have asked us if they auszubringen support the theories the Klimawissenschaftler ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere ? 
- I should really have first Informationsmaterial before I my opinion ... 
- ! no problem you know the subject ? 
- no , not totally ... 
- Überhaupt ? - no 
here a letter from Wählern is the people are concerned . 
- what are you ... 
- we dokumentieren the Geschehnisse . 
- well , I don' t know . 
you have to be a Legitimation here ? 
- yes , we are . 
we' re in the Security- , Check through . - ... through our Creator ... 
- well , I don' t think so . 
- please you don' t touch me ! 
- - you lying ... ... it ! - , no we do not . 
we should what lied ? 
- no , INDlSTlNCTLY ] [ ... 
- what are we have lied to the court ? 
it' s a little strange , or was it ? 
- I' ve heard no nothing about . 
- okay 
and it from looks so ... if this Programme are already -- 
I don' t have carefully to me with this ... ... let me take a look at you ? 
- that I can do to ! 
you know ... 
- actually , I have to go ... 
- we can talk about it ? 
- yes ? ... 
no ... 
you let me get that . 
I' il see me that ... 
I' il watch that ... ... and negotiate then help . 
- Herr General ! 
this program . this open Geheim- program , Aerosol - Sprühprogramm , " Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering " ( SAG ) , ( SAG= Stratosphärische Aerosol- Sprühungen ] 
- what ? - in the sky bins Aluminium sprühen ... 
- I have no idea what you' re talking about . 
- okay . 
- it' s called the üblicherweise " Chemtrails " ... Sir ? 
- come on , hurry it up . 
- when you were the Director of NIMA * , you' ve seen the Aerosol- flick ? ( Nima = National Imagery and Mapping Agency ) - no . 
Mike Murphy , Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we hear the subject " Geo- Engineering " ... ... and we wanted to know if you support the theories the Klimawissenschaftler ? 
- Congressman ? 
- hello , people . 
we wanted to know auszubringen if you support the theories the Klimawissenschaftler ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere ? 
- I' m not familiar with it . 
- I beg your pardon ? 
- I don' t know what to see you there . 
- I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
- okay . - put the question in my office ... 
I' m not Anhänger ... 
I don' t have carefully it to me ... that' s right . 
- I didn' t ... 
- you have heard of the subject , because it' s ... ... a public statement now , in the mass media come and in re going to discuss Kongress- Kommitees about this Programme . 
I think before we do anything in the atmosphere before we should know the effects , isn' t it ? 
- yeah ! 
- and if we don' t know it' s some effects , we shouldn' t do it . 
I think we have four ways if we think about the choice of Geo- Engineering . 
the first is : 
verbieten we it easy ! 
I' d argumentieren that you should be ... ... not on the basis for little Studien to restriktiv ... ... that it' d better put the hands of science . 
I think durchzuführen the scientific community Versuche in kleinem Maßstab in this ... " section " ... and it is a scientific question , what should be right this " section . " 
it wasn' t make too much Beaufsichtigung and Beschränkung ... 
Mr. politician ? 
you will forgive ... 
I' m treat Mike Murphy of L. A. We the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
these people out run of this Geo- Engineering thing . 
I wonder why ? 
- I gotta talk to my Mitarbeitern about it . 
I know the details . 
- you did on somebody on the subject s kind do ? - , sir ? 
, Mr. politician has anyone ever been talking to you about the business of Geo- Engineering last November ? 
you' re a Befürworter this theories ? 
we' d give you like to papers about it . 
- about what ? - Geo- Engineering ? 
you know anything about that Geo- Engineering subject ? 
. . . . . . never heard no , no , no . 
the something about the never I' ve heard is . 
when today in the sky we say , we have go see that already . 
- you have never heard of Geo- Engineering ? 
- no . 
noisy to shoot the theories 10 million tons Metalle in the air . 
the Komitee for science and technology , it has it' s for the first time ... ... no ? 
- no , never heard of it . 
- well , we were very fond of me . 
- hi , how are you ? 
I' m fine . 
- well , what is it ? 
- we' ve spoken with the office of Kongressmitglied Watson ... ... and their Pressesprecherin , Fr . White was familiar with the Gesetzesentwurf " space Preservation Act " the Abgeordneten there' s a man named Dennis Kucinich ... ... he' s mentioned Chemtrails and the Militarisierung of atmosphere and galaxy ... ... later on , that was ausgeübt from the Gesetzesentwurf to streichen . . . . . . ... ... you' ve seen the Aerosol Sprühungen about the Capitol today ? 
- politician ? 
- I' il get to them later ... 
Geo- Engineering is there a tremendous Bandbreite to Unsicherheiten , ethische and political Bedenken ... ... and the potential for katastrophale Nebenwirkungen on the Umwelt . 
he' s not one of the very often interviews , so there' s that . 
- well , you' re not stopping the breath on . 
... ... than Chairman of Komitees for Gerichtsbarkeit I feel obliged to anzustoßen me a public argument about it and anzulegen a report/ ratio about Geo- Engineering . 
we want to know if you' re a Unterstützer the Maßnamen , 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... 
- to sprühen no ! - ... ... in the atmosphere ? 
- no ! 
I think we need more research . 
okay . 
and about the aktuellen bid ? 
there' s linear a mountain to Beweisen , the nachweist believe - how many people - that this Programme re already in the bid . 
- you know anything about that ? 
- no . 
it' s safe to drive around here a mountain to Beweisen . 
but I unterstütze research towards Geo- Engineering and besides , I unterstütze it , anzudenken a internationale administration whose . 
everyone that has examined know ... 
I think that radikale theories are this , and I hope we don' t have to use it ... ... but it could do the time of the that we are forced . 
if we could vorlegen you proof the walk belegen that this Programme are go already and JETZT ... ... you' d get that then got no need to language ? 
we had already 3 , 4 Meetings ... Sitzungen to this subject . 
we have angesprochen the a public statement . 
well , not the theories , but the aktuelle bid this Programme . 
I unterstütze the aktuellen bid t . 
I think we need more research . 
this could have consequences , the hinausgehen about a country ... ... and I think we should s too the question the guidance . 
a subject ... while the Einsatzes s not just , but VOR the bid ... ... especially in Hinblick on großangelegte Feldversuche . 
I to give that it will see to speak with this subject and generell t like about world- Reglemente . 
started when those people over the Notwendigkeit a Aufsicht through the United Nations Security Council to speak , ... ... a national Umweltsicherheits- Behörde über- with a strong Mandat the United Nations ... 
it' s all right , that they are looking for a years of world power to the Manipulation the Umwelt . 
but I think it must be lash a sort of internationaler contract , the every nation in a common destiny . 
it' s a common destiny . 
unfortunately , it' s not just big know this , they could do that . 
too little know this . 
or maybe Milliardäre ... ... the say , " I' il save the world , alone , and I' m not to mention the trouble , that too . " 
how we determine when we have a world- Notsituation ? 
whose hand is the Thermostat ? 
how we determine when we start with it ? 
aktuell we have to do not an option this . 
and what if we have to start with it , and then a problem with technique or the angle , we sodaß can' t durchführen it longer ? 
in a or two years the Aerosole come from the atmosphere and the Temperaturen il go then much faster than right now . 
it' s anzupassen this Veränderungsrate , the it makes us hard us . 
so if we have begun even so , we will be forced it for long , durchzuführen long time ... ... basically without end in sight . 
Boeing d streben to tie after this profit , right ? 
I mean , there is to do a finanzielle angle that ? 
hmm , we see that ... 
so , you wouldn' t speak to me for Boeing . 
- don' t mind is that ? 
- well , it' s what it is . 
but one day , when the United States decide to do this , they' re looking for a company that most needs the can do ... ... and she would be aufgestellt there ... ... Boeing the assignment would have drink it dear , instead of him Lockheed Martin . 
of course , we have the industrielle basis for that the country can I suppose around Technologien and big a challenge , beispielsweise , Landesverteidigung . 
and we' il do the both of Profitgründen than ... than service for the country . 
I think it would be really verheerend if we have to learn to answer in a few years , that it has given it a Geheimprogramm and some government ... ... to to the Stillen what it' s like to bewerkstelligen . 
it' s pretty clear , that you can the planet cool , but they can and will can' t return the same Klima , started with the her . 
I to take , they have - or neither - how sinnvoll it a lot for and Wider with the question is to vermindern , the risks the Klimaveränderung . 
I think how good have a lead have that it would be free useful , but we don' t exactly know ... 
but it back bring her certainly not to that' s demselben Klima , with the they have started . 
hierin are all himself einig . 
- do you think we have the bid to our in life ? 
- I' m saying : 
I hope not . 
- Al ? 
- I to say . 
I hope not . 
- I sure hope not . 
I can see this as a sort of Rettungsplan ... ... than you know ... ... ... ... maybe Emissionsreduktionen to the to stop s auszulöschen her . . . . . but if they should , she' s coming gewissermaßen do what gewissermaßen the brig big Deiche to do is to try ... ... in case like a disaster . 
so I see these Optionen more than Katastrophen - Notfallplan and not a possibility of Verminderung the risks the täglichen Klimaveränderung . 
you would reach a Verminderung of Fleischkonsums befürworten than a way you target ? 
- ähh ... ... yes ! 
- how you doing , that we knock umzusetzen that ? 
you can' t ... I can' t ... 
it' s to decide your job , what is besteuert and don' t . 
obviously , if they want their behavior change people , she' il give them Anreize or Abschreckungen for your behaviour ... 
- that' s the answer , they wanted to hear it , Mr. Smith was sure . 
- if my time wouldn' t be past only . 
because literally putting on the whole world Aluminium and Barium Verseuchung will be found ... ... and you believe , it' s coming from this Programmen . 
see you tonight , about the capital , it from looks like Aerosole will ausgebracht . 
you have seen it ? 
- no , but I can see it . 
in the James Bond script a rich bad planes , Moonpie aufsteigen to impfen to the Wolken . 
how can help you ? 
- I' m like to talk to you . 
just call my office on . 
- okay , you know the subject ? 
- say how , Termine about the office . 
- you are a Befürworter this theories ? 
how you get that ? 
- I I don' t know anything about it and I' m late . 
- I have to a hearing . 
- okay , we' il get you a letter about it . 
- that' s a letter to her voters s ... 
- I' il take that ! 
- that' s wonderful ! ... ... and a lot of people believe that this Programme are already because massive Verseuchungen been found . 
- I don' t know what you mean with " these Programme . " 
one , two words say ... - Geo- Engineering Programme . 
- understood Geo- Engineering . hab´s ! 
which plane versprühen . 
so , what here' s what happened : 
people in the world find Verseuchungen ... 
- I' il take care of it . 
I speak with them when I get back . 
- thank you . 
we' il see that we can communication , even if the Durchschnittstemperatur about right , re gonna change the Niederschlagsmuster of today , but . . . . 
some places to be warmer a little and going some places . 
well , it will give winner and loser , with this Geo- Engineering activity , if we make it ... ... but nichtsdestotrotz , how said David on . 
there' s reasons why we should pull it in Betracht . 
a lot of people are concerned hard about about the Giftigkeit of Aluminium what was angesprochen do in several Komitees on . 
they' d throw please a look at this letter of some your voters of this Bedenken anspricht . 
- excuse me , I have to go ... 
- okay , I can give you a letter from Wählern . 
you know about the Vorschlägen about the Versprühen ... 
- I' m a little late . 
- I see . 
thank you . 
well , I don' t know about that bescheid , so I don' t know what to do . 
okay ! 
so the Geo- Ingenieure going to get hit , Aluminium and Barium in the atmosphere ... 
why would you do that ? 
Aluminium a wertvolles metal we can use . 
to cool well , that would explain target it' s the planet , however there' s a ... 
sounds strange . 
- that' s right . 
so , they make of this Metalle in the air too little bubbles , abzuhalten in principle to the Sonnenstrahlung ... 
we' re here to find out what the Kongressmitglieder ... 
- I hope we have to do a serious hearing about it before we determine us that . 
- I hope it ! ... ... and there' s ausreichende have a lead , the andeuten not only that this Programme re already in the bid ... ... because we' il find Aluminium - and Barium- Verunreinigungen in the rain , snow and floor . 
- okay , thanks ! 
- thank you . 
L. A. County has verzeichnet a hundred percent - igen Anstieg with Alzheimer- occasions in the past decade . 
many reason - and Wasserproben show big values of Aluminium in the entire Bundesstaat . 
why don' t you give me all the information , they have . 
I have some very good elements , the I' m beauftragen it . 
- and if you go to Mr. Lavelle ... 
- okay ... 
he' s my card . will you send me a Email and we ... 
we' il stay in contact . 
we' re checking the and as a mountain of Hinweisen , the nahelegen that this Programme s literally putting ... 
schieben give us the mountain over there and we' il see us this ... 
- if you see in the sky , you' il win some ... 
- okay ... 
will you ! 
you can be quite see how this Aerosole versprüht of the aircraft ... 
well , thank you very much . 
the future of humanity off are a lot of us . 
we count on people like you ... ... all the a few Initiativen . 
thank you , thank you , guys ! 
- all right ! 
thank you . 
a lot of Kongressmitglieder s runtergelaufen the lead out and has been looking for auszuweichen to doors in the Gängen to the questions ... 
well , obviously the war is for all of us , and we are all in a Geisellage ... 
, people an oath schworen , hochzuhalten the Constitution and defend don' t know is that happens this , but beteiligen to even about it . 
and we all have vorzutreten the duty and our mind to say . 
why the water is verseucht ? 
why the earth s verseucht ? 
why to get sickness , they' re with Aluminium in context and make betroffen all of us ? 
and so we' ve got vorzutreten all the duty and auszusprechen to informieren and this to stop , in our own terms and the our children . 
this is a entscheidender moment in the history of the world is ! 
we beings must decide us if we want to live on our knees ... ... while we besprüht every day , and will poisoned ... ... and live under ständiger threat or if we stand up and as free people ... ... the streben to truth , justice , peace and freedom of all . ALLE children of God live ! 
as you can see , we finish our movie here in Washington DC . 
we have hingewiesen many Regierungsbeamte on this . 
have the most either abgestritten every Kenntnis ... ... or were just not ready to speak with us about the situation . 
now , as you can see , that' s behind the White House ... ... we have the Aerosole . 
the Sprühen s weitergegangen . 
what the answer is ? 
the answer is in Washington , DC ? 
bound to . 
that' s the solutions is a but the answer is not just here . 
the answer is in DIR ! 
this subject concerning all of us deeply . 
now , look in your Innerstes . 
please , will operational . 
in you . 
catch on it weiterzusagen with steigendem Bewußtsein . 
we think the people that are over 90 % in Unkenntnis ... ... and that means that 90 % of the people who would do normally do something ... ... if she' d know it , but nothing , because they are nichtsahnend . 
now , look at your heart . 
use your choices , what they' re even after the message to are . 
the future of humanity off are a lot of it !

the smell the dead was like poison in the air . 
a dreadful , predatory and erbarmungsloser than the war had hereingebrochen about us . 
a Pestseuche , the half of our Königreiches dahinraffte . 
where they come from ? 
how she verbreitete ? 
the priest told us , she was the sentence of God . 
but for what sin ? 
what bid had broken we know we had deserves something ? 
no , we knew the truth . 
the God' s work was not , but Teufelei ... ... or witchcraft . 
and our job was in it , for the healing by God to the Dämon catch . 
brother Thomas ! 
brother Thomas ! 
- who' s got on ? 
- brother Ignatius . 
- it was the Pest ? 
- that' s ours was t say . 
I didn' t sign . 
please brother . 
let me out . 
Averill . 
thank God you' re in safety . 
- where you been ? 
- locked him up . you found me sick . 
- I have kept you for dead . - it' s fine . 
I was praying for you . 
the whole time . 
I' m fine . take it easy . 
I have brought you something to eat . 
one of our brothers have died is this morning , Averill . 
even the cloisters away won' t shield you . you have to . 
you in the forest of Dentwich you have to hiding until s all over . 
Sunday the Abt said the Pest be been , wegzuwaschen of God , for our sins . 
- Bestraft us God ? 
- no . 
you have to go now . 
you have to go back to Dentwich . 
you have to go now . 
- Osmund , I ... 
- you kiIled else , Averill . 
and don' t you ? 
come on . 
if I quit this nunnery now , I' out , my God . 
did you tell him yet on . 
you know that Märtyrerkreuz in the forest of Dentwich ? 
I wait for a week every morning , there on you . 
and then I' m away . 
forgive me , Father , I' m confused . 
I confess , I' m going - and hergerissen . 
I can serve get out of this Mauern ? 
I' d go away from here , but you never of your way abkommen . 
show me your sake . 
father , I give a sign . 
I' m Ulric , Gesandter Archbishop' s . 
what I say now , can we are operating outside of Mauern dringen . 
the Bishop has to hear that a village s not like everybody else . 
it' s the speech about it , it was a Zufluchtsort before the Pest . 
many villages s been destroyed not yet from the Pest . 
it' s entziehen , this Dorfbewohner felt the icy air of handle of Death . 
then they are be sure to big Abwegen . 
we' re us in difficult time . 
, so Behauptungen be like it so amazing as we can find with less Gebildeten two Gehör . 
just so we' re Gerüchten and the Aberglauben t aneim . 
God be public has no more real wired . 
we have to worry Geboten ten to Antwon' to seek for the herd out of this incident not in Versuchung , outside the church and God . 
I have to see yourself as this village lived the Pest . 
what we have to make it ? 
, the village that I' m looking for s the big one Moor . 
I wanted a leader , a Gottesmann , the me weist the way . 
here , there' s anyone who might be gewachsen a this job . 
with the Archbishop' s blessing I can auswählen me every here . 
but , of respect for you , I let you the choice . 
I can hinführen you . 
no , he' s just a Novize . 
- that' s more experience require . 
- let' s talk to him . 
you said that gesuchte village leaving me in big drink Moor . 
I on swelled in the corner , in the forest of Dentwich , and from know me there . 
he verfügt about the from me geforderten Erfahrungen . 
you will lead us . 
we to break in Morgengrauen . 
Osmund , this man is dangerous than the Pest . 
father , I was praying to have a lead . 
God me s tet geantwon' . 
even if you überlebst this , the world will change you out . 
maybe I' d like to the point , Father . 
I lived with my beloved in freudiger sin , my dearest has a geschwärzte skin 
my dearest , and I Liebten us so brave well verrottet my dearest it' s so early in the grave 
we have our leader . 
God no man has more left . he sent us a boy . 
- think you can handle it , son ? 
- I can hinführen you . 
pray so that you can do it . 
it every through cut the ass to the throat . 
what is this ? 
how much he knows ? 
Ulric was right knauserig with the truth , can tell you . 
... ... you this village , in that we travel have abgeschafft God . 
a Dämon has eingenommen his room . 
it' s called , victim il make eat , people people and dead to move back . 
we' il get us the leader . . . . . . then follow confession , trial , the execution . 
the Bishop want to go even with a Totenbeschwörer to the court . 
what a Totenbeschwörer is ? 
anyone the dead get out of the cold ground and new life them einaucht . 
we have the equipment , we' ve got the sake . 
we travel in the hell . 
- but God take us . - you got a mistake me . 
come back to your nunnery , if you' re cheated you . 
don' t you come with you and the work of God verrichte . 
let the thing us clear up soon . aufbrechen let us ! 
and you , too , Swire . 
we' re not as bad as you think . 
we' re worse . 
but we need you alive . 
you seem to know how these other s alive . 
I was long in the king' s army , together with Wolfstan and handle . 
I' il tell honest . 
we have seen take the Dämon never . but we know how it is . 
- what' s the matter with him ? 
- Ivo was trapped . 
he talked not , and so him have rausgerissen the French your tongue . 
- and he ? 
- Mold have to leave you alone , it will be done for a Blutbad have to . 
and Dlaywag , that a Folterer , a hanging judge . it' s name is he was also a murderer , thief , and Vergewaltiger . 
but this he' s a good man . 
what about Ulric ? 
I got a wife and child . 
I' m here because of the money . 
Ulric s here because God has aufgetragen him that . 
- m burning ! 
- have mercy ! please , have mercy ! no ! 
we gotta help you . 
you can hear me ? 
you' ve deserve to burn it . 
burn her ! 
burn the witch ! 
burn her ! 
you have brought sin about us all ! - you' re with the devil in Bunde . 
- what she has of illegal ? 
- you brought the death in our village . 
- the death you don' t have to ask . 
- that' s nothing to you . 
go away . 
- I' ve done anything ! come on ! 
get out of the way ! 
- what before he you the woman ? 
she was poisoned our well , now our half the village is dead . 
I have mercy our water , with no one to come and ! 
- I' ve done anything wrong ! 
- liar ! 
that dying started after she was on the well . 
- she has confessed ? 
- we saw how she has gezaubert . 
burn now must save them , so we the rest of the village ! 
move . 
please you a second time . 
thank you . 
hold never on . 
come on , you Faulpelz . 
so sure , like sun on - and goes down , re witches burn . 
in a village in the north 128 witches were verbrannt in one night . 
that' s 8 hours 16 per hour . 
when the night was over , they had killed everyone women in the village . 
at the end of the week the men pigs vögelten . 
the Pest s enough not yet . God brings to shag us to say , pigs . 
- you' ve been in the village that we' re looking for ? 
no . but I know where it is . 
the hell awaits us both . . . . . . so we got said . 
if you didn' t the guts , then go dear right and I get your share of the reward . 
what the church mean , how do this Pest come ? 
I don' t think so , like so many that be punished God us . 
I say , she comes from France . . . . . . from there all Übel come on . 
maybe you' re here a second the truth close , Swire . 
three Sommern we were fighting with Crecy in the Normandie . 
king Edwards army was unterlegen zahlenmäßig . 
in 20 of us at least 100 French came . 
and the French . oh , these Frenchmen ... 
you like a on the victory . you could smell him . 
but on that day our Schützen took this is the first one the Langbogen . 
the laden can be hurry , the Pfeile go on the plane . 
her Pfeile were no use . 
you couldn' t reach us . 
but our were like a dark , summende cloud . 
the night the field with her dead and dying was übersät . 
even in the toughest battle it' s usual , einzusetzen the Misericorde . 
the Misericorde s the " Barmherzigkeitsspender . " 
you trumped through the Achsel straight into the heart . 
quick and painless . 
but on that day there was no ritterliches behavior more . 
king Edward every French , the killing was still alive , without Barmherzigkeit , befahl . 
poor , heads , legs , everything was abgehackt . 
the biggest Army has to a bunch of wild . 
forgive me , but what has this to do with the Pest ? 
on that day we a luden death to us . 
he' s leaving us ever since then t take it no more . 
the woman that you were killed , that no witch ever was . 
why you' re angeschlossen you us volunteer , monk ? 
serve to God . 
you are God , by person you' re witches . 
the woman was already dead . 
I' d out of her , the mob have captured and verbrannt them again . 
I got you the suffering erspart . 
sometimes that' s all , so what can you do yet . 
he said we should go back . 
that where where we wanna go , re mad to savage the men . 
must be so special , that' s weggelockt you from the cloisters . 
- want me t you tell ? - no . 
you know , what is my job ? 
I' m a Folterer , a Wahrheitserzwinger . 
I' m planning to spend hours with a husband .

handle the Absolution , guts require has to teach . 
you really thinks let her live again in the village the dead ? 
I wouldn' t be here when I dächte t do that .

that' il find out you , too , soon . 
now go to sleep .
