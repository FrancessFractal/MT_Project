- German WITWATS Subtitles version of 1 05 ( 2010- 12- 07 09 : 15 : 
it could be a strange that Substanz , found of a man in Südwesten from Arkansas , s part of the test government ? 
the question is erregt rund for a phenomenon called " Chemtrails " , this neuerdings big attention . 
they say the government versprüht Chemikalien about us to the weather to controI and to change . 
and they say , the ungewöhnlichen Kondensstreifen in heaven re in a Chemikalien- beladene " Chemtrails . " 
they say people , the government versprüht up there , Chemikalien to the weather to change and to manipulieren ... ... and leave in there and see what you call it " a " Chemtrail . 
so , when I think there hinsehe and that Kondensstreifen are you tell me that Chemtrails " is " ? 
yes ! 
a Kondensstreifen aufgelöst himself had already . 
that' s interesting , Christina yes . 
this subject interests so not just in this country , but also in the European countries ... ... actually , the whole world . . . . . . are a lot of people on this subject interests ! 
Dave , you' ve mentioned that Klimaforscher and others , study believe that the atmosphere ... ... that she must be any sign of this , ominösen Komplotts would recognize . 
our journey started in San Diego , California , where met a scientist , tausende Ingenieure , political Entscheidungsträger and Journalisten ... ... to the American " Association for Advancement of the Science " - conference . . . . . . . . . . . . ( AAAS=Amerik company for wissenschaftl . 
one of the themes was the künstliche Beeinflussung of Erdklimas , called , " Geo- Engineering . " 
during the conference scientists Plausibilität talking about the " " the Durchführung weltweiter Klimaveränderungs- Projekte ... ... under the cloak " Verhinderung the Erderwärmung . " 
a theory that breite Akzeptanz enjoy slams sprühen of " ETWAS " in the atmosphere . 
when scientists have been asked to already laufenden Aerosol - Sprühprogrammen , they erklärten ausdrücklich , that no derartigen Programme were umgesetzt ever . 
oddly enough , but those theories entsprachen the same ... ... what people rund around the world say that already happened to you now . 
when I heard that the American " Association for Advancement of the Science is abgehalten " - conference here ... ... and to a large portion of the themes to Engineering Geo- ... I had come out . 
I had to be there . 
I had to hear what you have to say this top scientists Klimaveränderungs- . 
eingesetzt ... ... to the other question to Chemtrails " " and Wettermanipulationen ... ... already now , without our know . 
I didn' t see them own here , except that I worked even in Regierungsämtern ... ... in a high Ebenen at the White House and the Landesregierung . 
I personally , there' d be more skeptisch ... ... but to be honest with you . 
" you can' t know what you don' t know . " 
Chemtrails ! 
the Internet they' re angegeben as evidence for erzeugt entgegenzuwirken that the government künstliche Wolken to the Erderwärmung . 
you claim that the American government verwendet with more Duldung the national government ... ... in Geheimen planes to Ballungszentren ... ... with Aluminium , Barium and Strontium to besprühen ... ... to the Bedürfnislosigkeit ? ) ( the people and so the Weltbevölkerung to your airspeed as indicated . 
I' m always a little skeptisch , because me , Appears to make the government ... ... for not capable , soetwas in such a big Umfang . 
that' s not rain , this is no time . 
believe it or not , Sie´s 
( Militärflugzeuge dt . " " Düppel = Radartäuschkörper versprühen in this Region , " Chaff " ! ) 
little Aluminiumteilchen , sometimes they are of the plastic or even metallbeschichtete Papierstücke ! 
you are to resist Radar- and , obviously , that trainieren the . 
so , they wouldn' t admit it , but I was many years Marinesoldat ... ... and tell them that easy . 
what' s happening here . 
, Militärflugzeuge , some West Airforce base ... ... get in the atmosphere up and throw Polyester- stripes come up out of the Key , some are a little breiter ... ... other once house from Fiberglas ummantelt with Aluminium . 
the Air Force kicks these things from her aircraft ... ... the then drop down , what a all day before sometimes . 
this is unweigerlich or military ... ... what goes on here ... ... the government the Air Force ... 
when they see such paragon ... ... you can be sure . 
there' s something up ! 
that is so little fine , magnetische little tiny- stripes ... ... ... from either Aluminium ... 
it' s a find out what' s really offence , and don' t . 
but it seems out , so if a lebensrettende Massnahme , is this the Militärs . 
the motive behind this Verschwörungstheorie augenscheinliche " is . " 
a Weltregierung ( Stimmengewirr : quiet in the hall ! 
order in the hall ! 
I can' t hear nothing . 
Mr Chairman ! 
I want this house versichern that stammen both than my Amtskollege the Gesundheitsminister an hour for correspondence ... ... to this subject my Ministerium have received , the different that this Verschwörungstheorie carries t ... ... a Körnchen the truth and beobachteten stripes ... ... just the planes from the Triebwerken . 
order ! ... ... and I think that anschauliches an example for the new Sprecherin Labour the party this is ... ... that she is out Verschwörungstheorien about the U. S. government . 
- order ! 
they call it " Geo- Engineering . " 
fight the Erderwärmung by chemischen dust bring you in the atmosphere and so schädliche Strahlung into space reflektiert . 
our Definition of Geo- Engineering " is . " 
bewusste , großflächige procedures in the system ) - ( Klima the earth . 
a Bandbreite of plans to Klimaveränderung was diskutiert . 
a klassisches instance s the Einbringung of reflektierenden particles in the Erdumlaufbahn . 
on the other hand , it might to think sometimes some good reasons about Aluminium . 
it' s it out that it Stratosphäre a lot of work for the Umweltverträglichkeit of Aluminium in the . 
the big thing is that a 4- even bigger Volumenstrom in little Partikeln s Aluminium than sulfur . . . . . . . and that is that we have a 4- d surface again for the same Strahlungsantrieb . 
we have a 16- about fach kleineren Koagulationsfaktor ... ( Partikelverlust through Zusammenschluß to great P. ) / time ... ... and the a Verminderung bewirkt really . 
from it looks like auskommen if we with a geringeren Mengen . 
and that' s the reason why the speech s in the Hughes Aircraft Patenten out of the year 1989 ... ... of Aluminium is . 
and that' s why we find Aluminium in Wasserproben , they' ve taken to the surface . 
and here we have David Keith ... ... who says Aluminium a 4- even bigger Strahlungsantrieb did . 
so , they want that we believe this , it' s about sulfur , but ... ... they' re verplappert himself and rausgelassen ... ... that Aluminium 4- s even better to reach for their targets ... ... and it looks like it when they were not that we know the effects whose . 
that little picture here s make some of a study about Nanopartikel - Fertigung the show , that you qualitativ hochwertige s very ... ... very simple what a plane ... ... qualitativ hochwertige Aluminiumpartikel , just by Aluminiumdampf sprüht oxidiert you , the . 
so it' s backing possible and there' s already a breite Literatur she' s got a busy with it . 
and you can do this , by killing either new planes , or is the bestehenden umrüstet ... 
well , there' s a couple of ideas ... 
you to ask at a Technologie- company , if you can umsetzen that ... ... and she won' t say it' s very complicated . 
they' il tell you : yes , we can do this . 
from it looks like Klimaveränderung through Aerosole Sprühpartikel ) ( s so cheap ... ... that expenses t even il be a subject . 
that means off the Umsetzung s a risk of Risiko- decision . 
to do that chance to do it to the risk t know . 
and it' s the problem , we like it , and verwalten grundlegend harder than any different . 
well , I told you , it is to get cheap Stoffe in the Stratosphäre and I' m convinced that that' s right . 
I don' t think that this is changing . 
but I think the more weiterforschen the less just we' il make this thing ... ... the complicated the effects il look for the Umwelt . 
that' s it ! 
because right now it' s just to get out ! 
so , I think if we forschen more , s il probably find out that it' s harder and komplizierter than we thought ... ... and that they are Nebenwirkungen to managen difficult . 
and that a healthy no , that' il make it easier Management is . 
of course , is the reaction gegenteilige possible . 
it' s gonna be a empirische ( =erfahrungsbasierte question : what people respond really when they find out that this plans . 
another reaction would be example : 
if this , scientists re so worried about to CO² little bubbles in the atmosphere ... ... that would mean that in fact that we should auseinandersetzen with us in the risk of CO² in the atmosphere . 
and by the way , it' s not really a moral danger . 
it' s more like Trittbrettfahren on our expenses times a grandma . 
... ... aktuelle Studien about the Luftqualität , u. a. from California Air Quality Resource Board of remember that stayed in little Partikel be especially For for the Atemwege . 
during all the argument hear today , I don' t have Erwähnung about this Fall- out ... ... I don' on the one so hochreaktiven Metalls like Aluminium to Vergiftung of ground and Grundwasser s been ... ... and that . 
the question is , what the effects of Materialien on the human health , if they were herunterkommen from the Stratosphäre ... ... in the little special Aluminiumpartikel . 
my elements in the study , Aerosol- , people from the university Carnegie Mellon have examined the effects of the human health ... ... and though we don' t have it , veröffentlich the first this is what we' ve done ... ... to berechnen to the Größenordnungen , not with pencil and paper , but ... ... with a Gesundheitsauswirkungen for an expert on people , if this could be a subject . 
so , to Aluminium or else Partikel , there' s a lot of toxologischer aspects , of course , the you must watch yourself right . 
but naturally , considering the enormen number of Partikeln and the Gesundheitsauswirkungen this little particles , the answer ... ... what we have it hasn' t been released yet , but this was first , what do we have here is an expert führende - some say ... ... the epidemiologische research on that in to health , that' s not even in Ansatz a subject . 
let' s give me again , in the atmosphere 10 million tons Aluminium versprüht , no effects of the human bless you have ? 
you leave me here be careful . 
separate to examine your we the question of Giftigkeit ... ... so , we have begun to Aluminium and released yet nothing ! 
so , we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and released yet nothing ! 
we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and released yet nothing ! 
Dane saw in on and said , 
so , you tell me that Versprühen have 10 to 20 million tons of Aluminium ... ... no effects of the human health ? 
he holte deep breath , schluckte , and he said : 
be careful you leave me here ... 
we have done no serious Studien to Aluminium , so it would be something we find that thing tomorrow , what we don' t have bethought . 
and it was just so the for me , what is gelangen to the public . 
it' s the schädigenden physics of the Aluminium , appear in the world be ! 
and here' s konfrontiert David Keith with this subject right there , and he looks so if she should have left now the cat from the bag ! 
we have done no serious Studien to Aluminium , so it would be something we find that thing tomorrow , what we don' t have bethought . 
so they do it , because the evidence and the Agenda re separated from the try to prevent this Klimaerwärmung . 
obviously , there' s some other targets . 
if Bevölkerungsreduktion , control , Waffen- aspects , of course , Telekommunikation ... 
all möglichen things , we know nothing about the genaues . 
we know it' s not really , and I don' t want mutmaßen , too , what exactly are these targets ... ... but one thing we can see all right . 
these things are not ... These things are not vorteilhaft for humanity . 
it supporting the intention of Elite . 
so , I think the question' s , where we' re moving the Trennlinie between ... ... Aktivitäten , they' re don' t mind and no globale ... Aktivitäten , the a globale ... and benötigen on need . 
Dr. Holdren has to explain are ready to the president' s in terms science and technology and ... ... than director of the science for offices and technique strategy OSTP ) - ( available . 
I look forward to his Beirat in the coming of years your betters 
my personal opinion is , we must leave Geo- Engineering on the table . 
we have to watch us the thing very carefully , because we' il be einzusetzen possibly desperate enough for it . 
what I will do when we were in the year 2040 or 2060 a dramatic Klimakrise ? 
with , we say ... ... or weitreichenden Hungersnöten Grünland that versinkt suddenly the sea ... ... and annehmbare the only way we can start abzukühlen , the earth be einbringen a direct surgery in the Klimasystem , beispielsweise by we Partikel in the Stratosphäre . 
of course we' il always have any things in the Stratosphäre . . . . . . so it' s not like that the Stratosphäre is untouched absolutely . 
but we don' t want any off that , and people do things ... ... they have a great Strahlungsantrieb ... ... or einbringen about a big longer Zeitraum Mengen to reaktionsfreudigem material ... ... what could have a erheblichen of damage on the Ozonschicht to follow . 
you know , maybe I' il take a Partikel in the atmosphere because I' m trying to make some money . it , or I' il take a Partikel in the atmosphere to scientific research to an and to try to understand that physics Wolken- ... ... I take a Partikel in the atmosphere because I' m trying to rain in definite Regionen to leave it ... ... and the Wolken to impfen and so more time in our Schipisten to do . 
and that many questions on kicks of course . it' s üblicherweise risikoreich . 
it' s probably got some people in a negativen Effekt ... ... but we could find them us in a situation in the auszahlt to take it out on us these risks . 
one of the things that really me re all in shock was the match the risks Vorteile and this Programme . 
so , the Vorteile : 
that was an element Abkühlen of the planet . 
some of the risks called were Ozonloch , droughts in Africa and Asia . 
I can tell you this : 
after I' ve been listening four days that scientists . . . . . . for four days Symposium ... ... I' m worried to rechtfertigen really , because s right now , rechtfertigen that them , rationalisieren and try ... ... a few really , really terrible , effects more Auswirklungen on our Umwelt . 
and formulieren basically the Verkaufsstrategie , the Umsetzungs and administration ... ... and the Finanzierungsstrategie . 
go to San Diego I had to write like all in shock of this Programmen that I was determined to me about it . 
after the Fertigstellung of Artikels in the night , I sendete angefügt this Internet- a magazine , with my Emailadresse . 
the next morning with my Email- Posteingang was überschwemmt Rückmeldungen of the world . 
why ? 
because I' ve mentioned in Aluminium context with Geo- Engineering- Modellen ... ... and then didn' t know that so many people are information about it . 
now , but it' s so , that metal il find - Aluminium - in big Mengen , far beyond more normal values , everywhere in the rain , ground and snow . 
follow in the calls from a strömten , the people were someone who desperately , recherchiert the this . 
that was for the tip- off of that movie . 
before we started to filmen , we had to meet find out the opportunity with one of our geschätztesten Autoren and Dokumentarier , G Edward Griffin ... ... for what he knew about the subject . 
I' d like to talk to you about a minute , a subject , this always more draw attention to yourself . 
called this subject , that' s exactly scientific " Stratospherisches Aerosol Geo- Engineering " mean , " " Chemtrail - phenomenon . 
me , this is Kontroverse Chemtrail against Contrail Kondensstreifen ) ( very well of him . 
as I have befasst me so , klarer a case is that . 
I' ve been watching the Entwicklungen of Flugzeug- Verkehrs since his frühesten days . 
I wohnte in the corner of Flughafens in Los Angeles . 
I can remember me to the first Jets , the rape there . 
what did the boy , for a noise . 
as a noise had experienced we never before . 
we got a lot to the end of the Landebahn and this Jets to saw her like rape and abhoben ... ... because a new experience that for us . 
I' ve been watching planes my life , and I know what are Kondensstreifen . 
I' ve been watching her . 
you house from verdampfter Feuchtigkeit to Eiskristalle that sucks in the atmosphere ... ... and shine soon verdampfen and get out of here , then how can see you . 
a plane is over , followed by a little white line right behind it ... ... and you ... ... about 10 or 20 Flugzeuglängen to it than that he' s gone ! 
by the way , can you keep an eye on these , too today from time to time . 
" there is a Kondensstreifen ! " 
, these other things , talk about the here we are not at all the same phenomenon . 
those planes flying over and white this smoke out little bubbles ... ... the whole of the sky Horizont until Horizont covers and s not even auflöst ! 
the question is : 
why ? 
I have my own Vermutungen , but I hope that a couple of good investigative Journalisten go out and get us the answer to my question ! 
I know , the usual thing herauskommt , if - and she will tell the - people , that' il do the no doubt . 
" yeah , well ... we' ve done it for EUCH , guys ! " 
" it' s for the good of the Allgemeinheit ! " 
" it is to prevent for the company . " free to the Klimaerwärmung . 
to impfen or maybe at the people against an attack with irgendeiner terrible Biowaffe . 
" we can' t take any rumlaufen yeah , and a injection in the arm , but we can save them besprühen and so their life ! 
you don' t look good , as we are . 
" we do it for the good of the society . " 
I know what it is , too , they' re always say it' s for your own good ... ... and mine . 
you to turn around . 
if we had to that the way , a Hurrican and a s in New Orleans to meet . 
and we on that we could take him like that he' s got instead , Mississippi ... ... where I would kill to save instead of a hundred ... ... so , more or less from 6 Mississippi , for 1 , 800 of New Orleans , Louisiana . 
and if you do that , aim you got there , this 100 men would murder you then ? 
here , there' s a lot of Rechtsfragen . 
it seems out , so if it' s appearing Sprühen mostly in NATO countries . 
I have seen it here in the United States , I have seen it in England , I have seen it to Scotland ... 
I have seen it here in Canada , and I have reports of people from France . 
there' s a Gruppierung here . 
any amount of political Gruppierung - globalem . 
it' s not only one American phenomenon . 
it' s international and I think that we should berücksichtigen the d like to examine your this , this fact . 
you' il find a political Gruppierung and a POLITISCHES motive . 
but my opinion bescheidene hierzu : 
it' s no way to your or my health . 
I don' t know what it is , but we' il soon find out it ! 
I' m sure if you' il find the old " Ratschlag follow the money " folgst ... ... you sooner or later , the answer . 
we have noticed quickly that we had to issue the same need this information . 
teilhaben let the public , people , let' know what will do this . 
Edward was a touch of this thing like that he has suggested to help us . 
so , after the just so seems that Budget secured ... ... it' s fertigzukriegen the deal now . 
and we don' t have to do this without any answers . 
we' re not a scientist . 
we ask genaugenommen just questions . 
and we will be very skeptisch with the answers . 
it' s eyes on the point . 
why people SEHEN t it ? 
you don' t hear it . 
you know , I don' t know . 
you' il get the facts not on the table . 
you know , we got big luck ! 
look , us here in my lap which way is like it . 
( laughs ) ... way ! 
- yes , actually ... 
- yeah ! 
- it' s going to be a fight ! 
- a Herausforderung and a fight . . . . . . but why we' re here ? 
- you' re now on ... 
- all right ! 
I saw the sky with a Zick- Zack- paragon of Chemtrails ! 
I don' t know whether more in L. A. or on the street , but I saw in heaven ... ... and thought . 
look at the on ! 
the Flugrouten re never ! 
that was a Gitter ! 
a Gitter ! 
a regelrechtes Gitter about the city , and I traute my eyes ! 
- milchig , white Wolken ! 
now from s all very einleuchtend . 
we have proof the Bodenproben with the Aluminium , Barium , Strontium ... ... and what can we read in the Patenten and what the Klima- Ingenieure say what' s gonna happen . 
for the Normalbürger a Volltreffer s it ! 
this heikler a moment for the herrschenden Mächte is . 
because she a verdeckte operation like that " Troposphärische Aerosol program , " or " Chemtrails " ... ... " project Ikarus " or whatever . 
it had many in the name of the years . 
and she rather it around in a public , science Klimaveränderungs- Sonnen- shield , because the Klimaerwärmung running from the rudder . 
so , right now the belly of the beast s just about us without schützende armour . 
I don' t care if the people believe in Chemtrails or not , the thing Klimamanipulations- should be enough frightful . 
and if people about Geo- Engineering know the truth , re obviously , Chemtrails ... ... because it' s DASSELBE ! 
so , we' re talking about a WELTWEITE plot ? 
Klima- scientists have suggested to make the world . 
we' re on our way to Redding , California . 
that' s the second step to the AAAS- conference . 
we' il see what I can find . 
we' re here in northern it at the house of Wigington Dane . 
he has about 2, 000 morning country ( about 8 : km² with a look at Lake Shasta . 
he' s told me about the a challenge they have up here . 
we have to speak with Dane . 
we' il see what' s going on his Grundstück . 
we' il see what he that durchmacht and he scores what Maßnahmen , and the Testergebnisse the he did . 
well , I' m from the Energiewirtschaft . 
I' ve worked in the ' 80s first Sonnenkraftwerken of the country , frühern , in the . 
my house was on the cover of the world biggest Magazins for erneuerbare Energien . 
well , that' s my Background . 
my goal is it , alarmieren to the public . 
a man of giftigem material herab re on us , point . 
about five years ago , the blue sky was üblicherweise and now he' s full of Striche and Schleier ... ... and practically NICHTS what' s see you in the Horizont and a natural cloud in heaven ! 
it' s actually all Rückstände Flugzeug- lines with this , ausbreiten up in Wolken , künstliche Wolken ... 
from the sky looks like a dirty ! 
no more white Wolken and blauer heaven , how have a few years ago . 
there it looks like with huge Industrieaktivität or at Waldbränden . 
we see that typischerweise every night . 
even in the Bodennähe clarity is reduced clear ... ... we don' t know bedecken that , except at the days , which we have to these long , anhaltenden stripes ... ... ausdehnen up and all the sky . 
in some days can even see you how these lines with abfallen there , like a Schleier . 
we to take that the particles absenken himself . . . . . . and we have the tests , the we will show that überschwemmt with Mengen to Aluminiumpartikel ... ... the literally putting zehntausende times are higher than the ohnedies up angesetzten Grenzwerte . 
so , we don' t talk about a geringe prozentuelle Erhöhung this giftigen substances . 
we talk about Mengen ... beispielsweise of the side of that mountain Mt . 
Shasta ... 
if you even hinüberschwenken there ... ... that a Wahrzeichen northern Kaliforniens , that' s when unberührtes Wasserreservoir is . 
- Aluminium . . . . . . our Shasta Schneeprobe of a Hang of Mt was 61. 000 ppb . 
( parts which Billon=Teile a Milliarde=10- ³ ppm : . 
that' s gewöhnliches Schneewasser . 
and the people drink this stuff , if they besteigen the mountain . 
and you think about that . 
Amtshandlung ppb is necessary on 1 , 000 . 
that' s 61- fach about the gesetzlichen Grenzwert and our climber giftige have a drink of water ... ... of Mount Shasta . 
Barium : 
eight- three , Strontium : 
383 
so in this summer , the people who bergsteigen drink giftiges water . 
in the morning , Grunde ! 
I don' t want to drink sure 61. 000 Mikrogramm a quart Aluminium . 
and again , we have already fache the values pH- in this country to the ten to go in and see 12- can prove that clearly . 
- any suspicions . 
we can prove that clearly this Metalle were in the rain . 
we have mehrfache samples . 
Bakkalaureus the Naturwissenschaften , Internationale school for Forstwirtschaft in Missoula , Master ... ... in Zoologie , Spezialisierung on Wasserfauna ... ... thirty five years as Wildtier- Biologe for the US Forstverwaltung ... ... and a couple of years before Bodenschutz for the USDA Bodenschutz service . 
besides , I ran Botanik- Programme , grass - and Weideland- Programme ... ... and this still cut . 
the moment I do a lot of Beratungstätigkeit for Meistergärtner . 
when I have begun a garden ... in the year G ... ... who was here , pH balance 5, between 5 and 5, 6 . 
this is the old Bodengutachten . 
you can see here , on this side ... ... my floor . 
here at 125 investigation , 126 ... that' s my house . 
and here , the Bodenreaktion ... pH to lie between 5 4 . and 6, 0 . 
and over here in the mud it' s tan even a little bit . 
here he' s just 6, 8 . 
and what' s this with the shoots in Ökosystemen ? 
from us and see that little things ... ... on the floor in well , we' il make this herumkrabbeln a lot of things . . . . . . she finds you don' t even more ! 
those little Gliederfüßer , the can' t you see beneath the Mikroskop ... 
with the here , you can see the Bewegungen ... ... the little wee , mikroskopischen ... ... a little bewegende particles looks like . 
this start to get out on ! 
you' re not going to get out things , but her to start . 
this is Eicheln the Färbereiche ... 
here it is Zedernholz ... 
come on , guys ! 
this should be mad pH- and the Messung re expecting a higher than 10 fach worth ? 
something right here by terrific t ! 
- those reports all look at you . 
a lot . 
- that' s 20 reports of here . 
two twenty . 
I' d say , 20 more to the ... 
all dangerous Mengen show Aluminium ... ... and Barium ! 
the science says here to komisches something ... ... and say the whole Schwarzmaler : 
well ? " and a neutraler , pH balance s not good ? " 
- no ! 
neutral s not good . 
neutral s not good . . . . . . if your ground should have one , pH balance of 5, 6 , then he should stay there , if you want to have a healthy anti- forest . . . . . . and if you want to have a healthy anti- garden , you should your beibehalten , pH balance between 6, 0 . 5 and 6, 
I think it' s necessary that we wake up and see what' s happening here because ... ... we' II ignore it can' t just because it' s getting worse every day and worse ... ... if we' II ignore it on and verdrängen and just say : 
we had Einweckgläser , all the new , sterilisiert , in which the rain we have gesammelt . 
and we had a HEPA filter Schwebstofffilter ) ( with the air , we have getestet . 
OK , so you have gesammelt rain and gefiltert the air . 
what did you find ? 
Aluminium and Barium . 
here a test that has produce 375 000 ppb s still . 
Barium at three . 090 , Strontium with 345 . 
yes . this is from a doppelwandigen pond . 
with EPDM- Dichtungsbahnen for Fischzucht . 
( EPDM = it Ethylen- Propylen- Dien- Monomer- Kautschuk : there' s no Chemikalien or sonstige Stoffe in this Dichtungsbahnen , they could gelangen in the water . 
this poetry was developed for use this . 
well , the of the pond speist was getestet and getestet again . 
no ! Aluminium nachweisbar zero ! 
the other can only source , the pond speisen this is Regenwasser . 
we' re here on a gefilterten Waldanhöhe . 
meilenweit away from jeglicher industry , interstate or like that . 
for a few days with heftiger Sprühaktivität we could see that a movie bildete up on the Wasseroberfläche . 
we have getestet this shift and the result : Aluminium and Barium ! 
after a half years Ansammlung we had 375 000 ppb Aluminium it . 
that' s literally putting giftig ! 
we can clearly , like in that what we see in heaven , the same , what is beschieben in diversen Patenten ... ... and the Stoffe in Erdreich stimmen with which the Patente agree . 
this Stoffe were 5 years not here ! 
Mengen neuartiges a phenomenon in this is that . 
in some occasions a Anstieg percent of 50, 000 , in case of Aluminium . 
the of the primordial Messung of 7 ppb up , what was ohnedies been up for 50, 000 % in five years . 
we have seen tiefgreifende changes in this time . 
Dr. Lennard Thyme , doctor in really . I' ve done with him a Gegenprobe and he says that the Oxide of Aluminium , Barium and Strontium change that , pH balance of ... ... one sauren down to a neutralen there . there is no question . 
- well , that' s just ... - that' s exactly what can keep an eye on you . 
- oh ... 
I' ve got a Doktortitel in anorganischer really from the ... ... State Oregon University , and worked with various Metallen and Oxidationszuständen . 
then I' ve done a postal Doktorat at the university Brandeis ... ... with the at the Stabilisierung the company Oxidation Metalle I worked . 
the target is find out how all this fügt in the dynamische balance of life . 
I' ve worked with Francis Mount up on Shasta and he has way me some Regenwasser- analysis ... ... however ... ... that got to do with Aluminium - , Barium - and Strontium- Werten in the atmosphere . 
so , I think the wesentliche Giftstoff in this Chemtrails is that Aluminium . 
the values , we can keep an eye on the of Mount Shasta re completely unacceptable ! 
if we speak of Metallen in germ Systemen , we don' t talk about Aluminium Massenware of the people think ... ... if she use Dosenlimonaden and like that . 
if it' s übergegangen once in the state Aluminiumoxid- , it' s out front now a shift in the Blutgefäßen and SCHALTET the LEBEN AB ! 
be eingebracht elements , if they' re not usually at the Umwelt , for once in the neighbourhood , a few proper Alarmglocken bell . 
Aluminium s most awkward in germ Systemen . 
hold on , sit down , it is not gonna go and the system off , nullifies - and then war´s ! 
by ansammelt you at the time of the Aluminium , that' s quite neurologische damage caused it ... ... because it' s ablagert himself than Aluminiumoxid there , put this on in there and dropped Over of normal system can' t be . 
the Gesundheitszustand of every man has to do always a man named Maß with Giftstoffen ... ... and Aluminium is known for krebserregende physics have to . 
the Halbwertszeit beträgt Jahrzehnte ! 
I think we should work too , okay einzubringen of this Giftstoffe of our Umwelt instead of more Gifte . 
it' s very bedenklich that we zuführen higher , if more Gifte , we the payments and the risks of cancer . 
it' s so sad , that people anzurichten think about it , einzubringen in the Umwelt to bewerkstelligen Aluminium for something in great danger and run of damage . 
wherever this Stoffe come here , too , they' re here ! 
the on us herabregnenden Metalle bestreiten t let himself . 
that' s absolutely no Spekulation ! 
say how already have to the Metallmengen up in the last four years to the Tausendfache ... ... and the line for Luftqualität in California has examined the of China herüberkommenden Aerosole . 
Mike , anzusprechen ... ... the reason why I was determined to me primär this is the subject , because I keep everybody else themes for zweitrangig . 
what could have aufzusaugen a higher than Dringlichkeit , don' t go to the door can ... ... and a Atemzug to get no air in Schwermetalle ? 
if our Böden il be poisoned , if our Gewässer poisoned ... ... what remains us , then left ? 
what we s aufwenden too always our time and power ... ... whatever our political shot , this is a salvage basis for all of us . 
we need to Atmen the air , isn' t full of giftiger Chemikalien and Metalle . 
we need ablassen water , that' s not verseucht all about whatever those planes . 
people have stopped to consider that our atmosphere is so thin , like a Farbschicht on a basketball . 
it' s an extremely thin , the shift possible life on this planet . 
you just as Physiklabor to mißbrauchen and that to experiment till she' s beyond any saving ... ... a stupidity of unglaublichem amount is . 
go if the people would understand that happen this sort of forced ... ... not only JETZT , it' s been geraumer time . . . . . . for 50 years has given it a lot of Klima - and weather - Veränderungs- Programme , entziehen the to the Kenntnis Großteils of a public . 
and if they think that s not vote ... ... that she should have noticed kind of that soetwas ... ... I would ask them to make things like " Agent Orange " anzusehen Entlaubungsmittel ) ( in the war in Vietnam , and the other things know this , because they have the power to do . 
because s no one here who she is . 
because she got these huge Militärmaschinerien , they' re all controI and maybe ... maybe they' ve seen yes .. that document the government ... ... for verfügbar jenen , the online in the Internet , whose name is " Owning the Wetters ) ( the property of the weather . " 
a erklärtes target our government . 
and not only our government . 
he' s mitgeteilt the Press Associated that the American government " techniques that has to Wetterveränderung " ... ... that it' s for the new guy , " Weltordnung " possible , cold million Americans to leave and the rest to controI . 
to this Wettermanipulations- Methoden ... ... the entire Patente to gear 
not just that exist , this ... ... but it also , we have verwendet , Senator Clayborne Pell´s vollständige statement and his own Erzählung zurückreichend to the Vietnam War . 
- we shall do all we can . 
- will I see what we can do . 
you got the scientists behind you . 
scientists be with you , at least DIESER scientists s the matter with you ! 
- I don' t have a Millionen- Budget , but I have to show enough to that s going wrong here something terrible . 
- all right ! 
then Arizona , the next Monday 21 . 
Senator Johnson to show Low . we' il be so long with the car on the way . 
- it' s a pleasure to meet you , ! 
- we love it here . 
it' s abgeschieden so , so calm and out peaceful . 
my name is Karen Johnson . 
I was 12 years in Arizona Parlament of Bundesstaates . 
I was 8 years in Repräsentantenhaus ... ... and four years in Senat . 
if a plane and überfliegt ... ... ... ... from a Horizonts the other end of the flick from the plane is enough ... ... and starts auszudehnen himself and wellenförmig more and more of the heavens to bedecken ... ... and stolen ausbreitet until it covers the whole Himmel ! 
how can believe only someone would be normal as that ? 
and then beneath to live and to know that herabrieselt - that' s what it is always - in one ... ... and animals on and on the ground ... ... so ... 
that' s frightful . 
and if people don' t really wake up soon , and the fact in the eye ahead ... ... that we have people make the terrible things with us ... ... and we' d better wake up soon fight back , and us , JETZT ! 
you know , I have 11 children . 
I' ve got five times a grandma . 
I have much to lose here ! 
I care what will stay for my kids left ! 
it' s just me and I' m very fond of me , what is left for her stay . 
Aluminium s giftig . 
besides , we know that anhäuft it yourself . 
we know index that we always more about it . 
we take it up about the air , we drink it with our water ... ... and we take on Mengen always more . 
so , the idea that will be more Aluminium freigesetzt ... ... in our neighbourhood , in a way , you have to describe how it' s very , very frightful ... ... and verstörend for us . 
those who issued of us , the Untersuchungen have done about it , s very worried about the information that Allgemeinheit s bad about it ... ... and anyway , that will do this . 
Aluminium s giftig ! 
we know that . 
you can just about it , for the body what Giftmengen are schädigend , but ... ... that it' s anhäuft ... ... anbetracht the fact is this erschwerend . 
the t worry about what will have expired it' s beyond the Meßgrenze ! 
why it' il be don' t mind that we' re always besprüht in the entire United States - on the whole WELT ? 
who pays for that ? 
so , get the cases Alzheimer like a Mondrakete ... ... what has to do with the obvious Anhäufung of Aluminium in the Gehirnzellen . 
I think almost everybody in a family member is to find that s under Alzheimer . 
and it' s a horrible ... ... a terrible affliction . 
and to say : 
" it' s just because the people drink Limonaden from tins of . " 
you know my father died with Alzheimer and he has never been drinking Dosenlimonade explanation . . . . . . that doesn' t sound very einleuchtend for me . 
and so , I ask me . 
how much did this Chemtrail- geschädigt Sprühen , back in the neighbourhood of Illinois him ? 
a friend of us for 20 or 30 years in Arizona , Feuerwehrmann Pine ... ... and he says that this Waldbrände , they are fight today , heftiger much as you have seen ... ... what they haven' . 
and if you get looks at the Luftmessungen and those little easy , flammable Aluminiumpartikel ... ... and that Magnesium on the trees ... ... that never dagewesene Waldbrände causes . 
here you can see . 
split it a million are . 
there' s zugeschickt me that , and I' m awfully find it interesting , because we should have just about two parts a million in our air . 
and it says here , we have 39 000 parts Aluminium . 
that' s worth a astronomischer ! 
the Barium- s worth up ! 
well , that' s beyond of good and bad ... ... what should breathe the people right on it herabregnet . 
and the people to wonder that your health s adrift , and she' s in the Notaufnahmen have to . 
why they have Atembeschwerden ? 
why they get Alzheimer ? 
it was planned ! 
we have such Eliten ... 
I don' t know how you want to call her . 
" one- Worlders , " " Illuminati " what I know ... 
how do you always call them . 
these people see t worry about the Durchschnittsbürger ! 
you see , just to yourself , your greed , your power ... ... and if they eliminieren so 2/ 4/ 5 or three of us from this planet ... ... s fine for these people ! 
because , then they don' t have to see to it that soviele people herumzutreiben and to see . 
well , it' s a lot of the worum´s s here ! 
and it' s very , very alarmierend and frightful . 
so where' s this stuff ? - come here and WARUM ? 
why s gonna be a pass out that stuff out there ? 
so , I' ve heard so many explain . 
" yeah , we' ve got to cool the planet cool ... " and this and this ... ... but when people trying the planet , why you need then these things in it ? 
the explain have geklungen never very authentic for me . 
when my Equipment aufstellte , I saw it on me and said : 
" the tree line here all die ! " ... and I said : 
please ? 
you said : 
" the tree line here all die ! " 
well , I thought , well , I teste talk to Aluminium , because that' s one of the Hauptsachen in this Programmen about the we here ... ... and Titan ... ... so I took a sample of of a bark . . . . . . and she ran a program test on the result was positive with Aluminium and Titan . 
and then I started in California herumzureisen , I bemerkte the same everywhere . 
in Lake Tahoe to find too many Rinden was the same sort , in the whole region from Sacramento , and Davis ... ... where I was all over , I bemerkte this silber- white bark . 
I think this Chemikalien a dringen in the floor and destroy the roots ... ... and then if they gelangen aufsteigen her in the bark of Baumes . 
these two over here , re just now ... 
it hurts like that , watching like this ... ... look like they' re big and old ... 
we' ve lost probably 40 trees on our 10 morning country . 
, every week , every second see a tree weekend more , the starts to die . 
it' s just so sad . 
we just gonna cry . 
and remember that have to do anything that might the to think , together with the other explain ... ... would frustrieren me really dreadful ! 
if you always a tree down ... 
this is just not right . 
it' s just a sad one . 
and here' s another one over there in this little Baumgruppe . 
it doesn' t feel better about in waking up and to fight in instead of a little leak to crawl and go to bed ? 
so ... GOTTES WILLEN , LEUTE UM ! 
your families s out there , your children are out there ... ... and your times a grandma ! 
I mean ... 
you MÜSST ETWAS TUN UM ZU HELFEN ! 
my greatest s hope to get people to Hinterfragen . . . . . . and if they not wake up , while we' re there , I hope pflanzen a few able to seed . 
we' re the most place of the planet . 
Hawaii ... ... to the score the things to see and data to gather . 
thank you , that plane before , you' re with us . 
however , we hope that you could get a chance to enjoy the trip . 
we wish you a great vacation " or " welcome home , if you' re so happy to live here . 
the whole of the valley s autark . 
we have either Sonnen - , or Windenergie or Generatoren . 
- look at that ! 
- yes , such a loser , you can' t even ausdenken himself . 
- right , right ! 
even if you come from becomes here , this paradise here just now s going to be destroyed . 
you make it to the " Insel- method . " 
you make it out to sea , removed from the island . 
and so , you see the planes Chemtrail- t . 
the theory , and that she is out to sea . 
- ... and so it in come to us . - ... ... and KOMMT HEREIN it ! 
these here come from west . 
and she sprühen today either of both sides at once . 
a lot of the stuff here is in fact of the Chemtrails out of this way . 
this Stoffe here ... ... they' il block off ! 
we should can see the Horizont ... ... there , where the earth krümmt himself . 
we' re up enough , we have the sea here , right ? 
we should can see " Big Island . " 
it' s just 30 miles away . 
and , as you can see , pull no blauer heaven is . 
this is the key ! 
that' s all , you know , it' s strange this blue ... ... flute of blue what I call it . 
and that' s a nice day today . 
you know , there' s no more blue sky . 
we' il see us today , the stars . 
it' s like ... 
you' il see it . 
you can ZÄHLEN her ! 
so many nights stars are to see now ! 
there should be hunderttausende stars , and you can they ZÄHLEN ! 
one here , a there ... ... a Planet here , it' s like ... 
sometimes can see ZEHN you a hundred , in some other night just ! 
this is what worries me . 
this stuff here . 
- that' s quite WEICH ! 
- okay ... 
you can abziehen it easy ! 
the bark , that doesn' t go ! 
I' ve seen hunderttausende Kokosnüsse , but never soetwas here ... ... they just fall apart ! 
you look at it , guys . 
soetwas I have never seen . 
" in Big Island " I' ve always gepflegt the trees . 
something vergleichbares , how the here I have never seen . 
and that' s besorgniserregend for me . 
don' t easy , the task you' re here on the island . 
I could see the Skepsis because it' s so beyond irgendeiner idea . 
it' s astonishing ! 
it' s trying to look amazing with the eyes of other . 
in my eyes , I see that ... ... it' s like day and night . 
other people about it ... 
the illusion s derartig tiefgreifend ! 
wakes up what do you think would happen if everybody ... ... and can understand what' s the matter , and what the plans ... ... that Klimaveränderer are ? 
I think ... I think it would give a revolution that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
if people would really understand what will have expired here ... 
what are your Befürchtungen ... 
I know you love this country here ... 
what your Befürchtungen ... ... ... to Chemtrails are ? 
well , that we can' t live here anymore , and anpflanzen our own Lebensmittel ... ... and that our health will attacked . 
- you think it' s already happened ? 
- yeah ! 
the fact is , that she make it every day ... every day . 
it' s a hämmern and hämmern ... ... and hämmern little tins of every day . 
and , of course , this only gets in the Umwelt . . . . . . and of course it schwächt the shoots . 
it needs a couple of years for schwächen ... ... to supervise the shoots ... ... and then we ask for genveränderten Taro . 
then we ask for genveränderten Papaya ... ... because we can' t anbauen our natürlichen seed more ! 
so we got a future ! 
we can' t live to be really here ... ... so , how did God created us . 
so my friend has into this to make me a Haaranalyse of my daughter . 
well , I got a couple of her hair Haaransatz , a few really new hair , and taken eingeschickt . 
I was so sure that hair unbelastet my daughter is gone , through the Lebensweise , the we have here ... ... and from there , it came back and their charts were really up with Aluminium . 
here is the analysis . 
this is the Referenztabelle here and the value my daughter is . 
23, 1 with Aluminium . 
heaven is fog covered with a white and if I aufsehe night , I can' t see , the stars very deep more . . . . . . and I can' t think too different than me that has to do that thing with the health my daughter . 
I don' t know where this Schwermetalle to come up there . 
- look just like old she is . 
she was abgeschottet here . 
- here ! - and she' s ... 
I' d feel like this . 
this is this paradise ! 
- this child would be super- healthy as a horse ... 
- a ... ... place with biologischem Anbau ... 
- here and we' ve got this all Schwermetalle ! 
she has the höchsten chart at Aluminium ... ... and they had no Impfung , too . 
friends , these people play God ! 
you play God and the weather manipulieren ... ... and she sprühen stuff in heaven ! 
you' re trying to change ALLES künstlich , and your shoots , trees and even the sea ! 
so , tonight we want you to know that instead of t mind anfangt ... ... hoping that anzusehen you . 
because I really think of my heart , that we have here is a crisis right ! 
really ! 
you beat einzubringen in 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere obere . 
what causes Aluminium ? 
that changes the Bodens , pH balance of ... ... and that' s giftig for the Vegetation ! 
besides , it is very giftig for the human health ! 
they do it really ? 
let me tell of my Erfahrungen and what have we found . 
we have many have a lead , don' t let the only assume so ... ... but , like , I think , these things happen to prove that really . 
and , like our very spezieller s guest here today . 
Michael J. Murphy , currently taking place of that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
he' s working on a Dokumentarfilm with the title : 
" what in the world what are they ? " spraying [ in all the world versprühen ) there ? 
Michael . welcome on camera . 
great tonight with you want to talk ! 
the ... the other day , he sees a friend of things always from another Blickwinkel . 
he' s a little such a Verschwörungstheoretiker ... ... ... and he says , whenever okay , the president arrives to L. A. , there' s no Sprühen the whole week . 
have a better place for an interview ? 
look at that ! 
it' s really ! 
about our Farmen and stuff . 
so , basically they want unterbinden your ability to ... ... biological Lebensmittel to eat , clean and Lebensmittel bad water ... ... so , from that looks kind of like ... ... for me , of course , it' s just a Prognose ... ... it' s hard for me to KONTROLLE ! 
" how we controI the masses . " 
how can only be good for Aluminium kind of a ... 
what the second stuff you' ve mentioned was ? 
- Barium ... 
- Barium and Aluminium . 
they' re obviously giftig ... ... for ALLES ! 
for the human health ... ... for people , for Farmen , for animals for ALLES ! 
- 61. 000 split a billion ... 
and behördlicher alarm should be at 1 , 000 ? 
at 1 , 000 ! 
and people drink this . 
the people who the mountain besteigen ... 
you drink this time . 
this is poison . 
oh , my God ! 
that' s grim . 
- well , that' s 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ? 
- that' s right . 
- 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ... 
I' ve spoken with friends in L. A. ... 
" oh , it' s just ice ! 
that' s Kondensation . " 
and I say : 
a Zweitklässler know , ice are not that and breitet to look ! 
you' re not expert , but a besorgter citizens , the said : 
" wait a minute , I want to ... " 
you recherchierst and that' s what we need to do as an American citizen ... ... and say : 
" you know what ? 
I want to know what' s going on here ! " 
I want to know what' s the Lebensmittelbehörde with my Lebensmitteln . 
I want to know what' s with the government the air , the water , the floor ! 
it' s great , what you' re doing . 
my thanks to you , because you are light in this thing . 
the whole Theorien set aside . 
what will suggest the Klima- Ingenieure and found what is spooky enough ! 
so , we can beschränken anzusprechen us on , all this point . 
and I ermutige make more people , vorzutreten and questions to ask you ... what he' s doing . 
thank you , Michael . thank you , thank you very much . 
Ausbringung of Aluminium- Aerosolen be affected everywhere . 
we have a magnificent , tropisches Klima , that' s how I believe in danger could be . 
so , we wanna come over here and I not only the news , what people have found in the world ... ... but , people ermutigen to test even after Aluminium , Strontium and Barium . 
basically , I think it was a wirkungsvolle trip . 
I have to see wake up a lot of people here in Hawaii , in Maui , not just curious , but , weiterzuforschen gewillt . . . . . . and that' s my only option . 
I think that' s one of the mutigsten trains of Ed Griffin ... ... until now . 
it' s the subject , Tabu- about that no one should talk ... ... and that Aerosol- Sprühungen are ! 
we have tonnenweise dokumentierte Nachweise about Aerosol- Sprühaktionen . 
' it to me ! just that Grundwesen of humanity was always hinaufzusehen in the sky and to ask : 
why ? 
no ! 
there' s no boundaries ! 
the room and the universe are endlos ! 
but now , in this 21st century we can' t do it any more ! 
, everybody , the aufsieht ... ... and the huge Gitternetze and the X- e the sky looks ... ... the not part of were till of a or two of our Jahrzehnten Daseins will explain aufeinmal for crazy ! 
and the people , the best and the biggest Verfechter are the freedom ... ... don' t want that you talking about , because it could bring them in Misskredit ! 
it seems to melken , as if there' s a whole Wirtschaftszweig built ... ... to the Steuerzahler by a sort of weltweites Sprüh- will raised program ... ... for a lot of money with this project to scheffeln ... ... and it seems to see her t go , what might have effects for this . 
you do not find out if the human can survive this or like that . 
you want to hinaufkriegen the stuff just there ... ... and DANN after we have gone to this way , then we ... ... that there' s companies , the on the fuck happened to Organismen profit ... ... the fuck happened to the seed , Getreidesamen were changed ... ... to the Aluminium in the floor to resist getting . 
many Getreidearten grow not in such a area . 
so , after her up the Böden ... ... have to go to the peasants them ... ... and the seed buy , they' ve changed to resist getting gentechnisch to the Aluminium , that was brought in the Böden . . . . . . and urplötzlich humanity is totally abhängig of these other companies like Monsanto and this huge Agrarkonzerne . 
you can' t even more anbauen natural seed . 
and we' il see about that . 
it' s a schockierende thing ! 
I hope we' ve gotta do not that , it' s true , but now ... ... indicates all that down ! 
we' ve got a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because H. A. R. P. A. [ high active Auroral Research Program ) could stand too hiermit context ... ... in Engineering Geo- - how did you angemerkt - that' s angeführt do in there' s a man named Dennis Kucinich´s Gesetzesvorlage ... ... the " space Preservation Act " often ... ... the last I heard , the Congress was not - that was nice of ya . 
and then Key Bail- out - how we call it here - Kay Bailey Hutchinson ... ... which has zusammengestellt to sit down , a couple of law , Geo- to Engineering in power ... ... something all of us , like , before the Klimaerwärmung to save me . 
it' s a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because they can pull in so many Aspekten good through ! 
- Ed , so they' re all , don´t you don' t ! 
- that' s it ! 
there' s this old proverb . 
" follow the money ! " , this will bring you üblicherweise the core of the Problems ... ... and for me out of it looks like here just a ungemein profitable industry s built ... ... rund to this concept " Geo- Engineering " or " Wettermanipulation " or " Reduzierung the Erderwärmung " ... ... and all the other things ahnungslosen a public sold can be quite simple . 
" oh , that' s all right . 
we want no Klimaerwärmung ... " ... and so do with it . 
and they don' t ask any questions , re not critical ... ... but in the Hinterzimmern can see you , that is an entire industry built ... ... the way I say , ungeheuer profitabel is ... ... ... and all the money for it comes from the Steuerzahler ! 
it is a pretense a ! 
basically , it' s it ! 
and we focus on this one , subject to prove , that' s very easy . 
on this area there' s no Spekulation . 
you are definitely this Geo- through Engineering . 
definitely talk to you about it . 
you work at the Methoden for it . 
you work for the Strategien out . 
you have the Budget for it . 
everything is in position . 
we don' t need more anzusprechen aspects , of course lock even to the case . 
well , they are people believe her Theorien . 
but at least they have to understand that it is out of the question that will speak about it . 
so , they ought to do not as alarmiert be about what' s the plan ? 
it can be proven that a very destructive have effects of this Barium and Aluminium and the other giftigen Metalle on the planet , and people . 
this isn' t good enough ? 
how many aspects , of course , we have to reinquetschen there yet ? 
well , if s planned to kill the planet and the people , we need to have it some other reason alarmiert to be ? 
" what in the world are they ? " spraying thank God , people that question ! 
we don' t want any more . 
we can only want to ask the questions . 
our good friend , G Edward Griffin . 
Mike , and Murphy and Paul Wittenberger ... ... this great to do with your help . 
that' s a Gemeinschaftsanstrengung to get to RICHTIGE information to the people . 
" what in the world a few Abschlußworte spraying are they ? " yet , before our time for ? 
the Abschluß I betone nocheinmal that we have to put that question : 
" what in the world spraying are they ? " 
and now we WISSEN what it is . 
and people , it' s not like you ! 
I' m Vereeke Peter . 
I' il be out in Belgium . 
I' m 54th years old . 
I can' t believe it yourself . 
I' m a very happy and dankbarer man . 
we' il do the job , the police , that Justizministerium or the Umweltamt had to do . 
- and it' s very important that this is a revolution Grassroots- ) ( of the basis . 
- I think so too . - because we don' t fight GEGEN , but FÜR ! 
- yes , we FÜR fight ! 
I was 25 years in the selectmen and a Legislaturperiode as mayor . 
from this moment - 10 years ago - himself had begun to change everything . 
I time to get to a picture of what will have expired really ! 
I was completely clear that we are fouled - humanity - , keeps ... ... and ausgebeutet ... ... and since the centuries ! 
this phenomenon Chemtrail- made me mad because I was so helpless . 
you can you decide which Lebensmittel eat ... ... what you smoked , you drink ... ... which life which you live water ... ... but not with this phenomenon . 
then you' re just a martyr ! 
it' s just a game . 
and the boys give it must have good and the bad guys . 
and the one we' re in position the matter of good to play ... ... the chance , the and the chance that Herausforderung have to überwinden . 
, the three days , the we teilten with them left my heart , leap because it' s so kind to live a wonderful . 
to live and so kind of a ... restful . 
at the departure well , I was wondering , how it look like 10 years in there . 
will destroy everything was on her Grundstück ? 
and if so , what , then their will be Lebensgrundlage ? 
you' il have to let himself zertifizieren of irgendeiner company XYZ ? 
and what would the Voraussetzungen for it ? 
this is the end of the freedom is then . 
that worries me very ! 
very ! 
I' ve learned to say here' s what . 
" now , everything is so , what it' s like ... " " ... and everything will be all right ! " 
- it' il be all right . 
- everything' s going to be all right . 
- yeah ! 
I have this tiefe feeling that we will be the end victorious ... ... because we have the right on our side . 
the Kosmos help us . 
and I' m strong , re supporting this feeling that we of Wesenheiten ... ... and Mächten of the we can' t even meet us ! 
well , for the first time , we' re gonna have the record , wissenschaftlichen ... ... that we besprüht WIRKLICH . 
we' il besprüht ! 
it' s unbelievable and hard vorstellbar ... ... but we' re besprüht ! 
I think stehenzubleiben , at this point , s no OPTION ! 
if you know it once , and this a tool like ve got a chance like this ... ... that Chemtrails- this thing or persistente Flugzeug- Kondensstreifen or , as usual , you want to call it ... ... that this phenomenon will recognized than REAL ! 
in a public Debatte ! 
the context with Geo- Engineering it is to get five- vor- Zwölf , this to the public . 
so look to heaven . 
the old are paintings . 
we have forgotten it , I' m afraid . 
in the years in them a journalist in the Medizinforschung tätig I was ... ... I' ve seen many , many things . 
what I always have examined , I found always the same three aspects , of course . 
we' re done dümmer ... ... we' re done sick ... ... and we' il do unfruchtbar . 
people from the world at or around this time ... ... down here in Belgium the first International Chemtrails- Symposium . 
this one has to discuss führende Fachkräfte , hergeführt politicians and Aktivisten ... ... to Gesundheits - , Umwelt - and social aspects , of course , this Programme . 
it' s all around here today ... ... with the full facts , Goodspeed , documents , numbers , Patente , Lizenzen ... ... all leads us to the truth . 
we don' t have any other weapon against these huge Komplex ... ... than that Aufdecken this düsteren works in Lichte the truth . 
however , we hope that see through our Anstrengungen more and more people to the fact ... ... that we' re geführt of our Führern hinters light . 
we' re zusammengekommen today than family ... ... to join to show for our powers, with the people came here to the world , that no theory Verschwörungs- ... ... but a Verschwörungs- TATSACHE are Chemtrails ! 
from the university Technischen Delft , in Holland ... ... ladies and gentlemen , please you and : 
Coen Vermeeren ! 
my name is Coen Vermeeren . 
I' m Professor at the university Technischen Delft . 
üblicherweise dimensionalen room are the people in the sand , their heads ... ... in her own zwei- and see t upstairs . 
if she do this , but they' re gonna recognise any more and more room like this . 
it' s me , too . was he playing ? 
I have can give my students no explanation for this Phänomene . 
so I have myself examined her ... ... and had in that I could give them no answer . 
because I think that this phenomenon s not NATÜRLICH . 
what' s happening s not NATÜRLICH . 
and the explain that was given to us for me re not zufriedenstellend . 
betrachtet you to explain anything from the wissenschaftlichen tone of he' s trying to step something first . 
I' m smart , my students re not quite so smart ... ... so I had to deliver them answers . 
but , if she put the most honest a question , scientists have to admit that , that I don' t have them on all the answers . 
if Klima- Manipulation durchführt somebody over our heads , then I don' t know that ! I want to know the consequences . 
I want to know the Gesundheitsrisiken . 
I want to know all about it . 
when teacher at my university I have to deliver the job my students answers . 
and they have good questions ... ... on the don' t I have the answers ... 
- ... and I want to know it . 
- fantastic ! 
and we should just about it . 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
for you here in Auditorium and for the world . 
Michael Murphy . 
thank you , thank you very much . 
it' s to be a great honor , here in Belgium . 
people at the power controI all ! 
they controI the Märkte , they controI us ... ... and now they controI even the weather ! 
and she can use it for kriegerische sole purpose . 
what she can' t controI ... ... the only s what has profit God . 
and that natürliches , biological Saatgut is . 
the name is " hierfür Hegels Dialektik . " 
- problem reaction - ( solution to Hegel : 
- Antithese - Synthese ) These 
the problem is this huge Mengen Aluminium . 
everything begins abzusterben . 
the solution to come from , X , they said : 
" hey , guys ! 
get your shoots Erträge no ! " 
" all die ! " 
" but we have the solution . 
we have Saatgut , it is also in such terms . " 
" it' s only one problem : 
now , you' ve got to buy with MIR ! " 
we' re fond of me , that could be a part of this Agenda , everything and , of course , is it a biologic abzutöten ... ... and to change on ! ... ... with genmanipuliertem Saatgut , it' s against Aluminium resistent . 
like some know , maybe we' ve just come back from a week Filmdreh in Hawaii ... ... it was a trip incredible . 
the people there are very worried because she keep an eye on that their Kokosnussbäume be sick . 
their Besorgnis is that Programme this could be a part of a great Agenda ... ... for all Natürliche , Organische to destroy . 
that the Großkonzerne her only Nahrungsquelle re in the end genveränderte Lebensmittel . 
I didn' t expecting that so many people , young and old ... ... on this phenomenon be interested ... ... and re worried about it . 
especially me s like the safety of the young girl today ... ... only 17 and haltend on a speech of audience . 
that' s incredible ! 
my name is Sophia Xenidis . 
I' m 5 years old . 
it' s creepy to know that the air , the we breathe , not that' s how it should be . 
that gives you the Lebensmittel , the we eat , the water we drink , tracks this substances ... ... the versprüht of us will be as if we were insects ! 
the feelings in the me auslöst are tiefe feelings of anger and violence ! 
I don' t want to be poisoned ! 
I don' t want to be with infiziert krebserregenden Stoffen . 
it makes me so angry , that is , in a world- Vergiften so gigantischen amount , always keep ... ... and not enough to be done gebieten to this crime , Einhalt 
a klare answer to a question : 
we' il besprüht ? 
we were besprüht ? 
and it' s too besprühen their us always on purpose ? 
what we' re gonna do about it ? 
- we' re with it ? 
how will we stop it ? 
I know the answer to my question ! 
there' s only one person that can stop this , and you know who this is ! 
you BIST ES ! 
you BIST ES ! 
the person on the you' ve been waiting for . 
we' re great , wonderful , a divine ! 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
sisters and brothers in here and Auditorium in the world ... 
thank you , thank you very much , that you were here with us here ! 
and now , enjoy yourself with this song ! 
hello ! 
good to see you ! 
come in ! 
I sure am glad you were good weather , until now . 
you to pretend we do in the winter . 
if you go to Washington , you could land on the snow . 
- thank God , we don' t do that ! 
- right , right ! 
you know , this with this weather Veränderungsprogrammen - it' s strange . 
I think there' s something about 32 alone in the American Festland ! 
so , the theory s that got to do with it too Geo- Engineering something Wetter- Manipulation . 
that' s an interesting point is , Mike ! 
it' s connected soviele Untergruppen with this subject Geo- Engineering . 
people us my orders are to contact the whole time ... ... with the information to connections with Klimaerwärmung , connections with Wettermanipulation ... 
some people think you are , there' s a connection to the Morgellons- illness , at all . 
other again believe , it' s up to a method of the transmission elektro- magnetic Impulsen ... ... of H. A. R. P. A. Antennensystems up in Alaska and Sibirien . 
there' s one of the head of to s humming and every issue of seems to be an investigation worth ... ... but we are so little time . 
I think it' s smart for us , that we' il concentrate our efforts to the Sprühprogramme ... ... and the Giftigkeit this Chemikalien , and the destruction of the planet and the Gesundheitsschäden ! 
what we need to convince more than the to the people that we must stop that ? 
so , focus I think it' s important that we us on it . 
Jeremy , we had an idea there ! 
we know that if you know the system , political really good . 
the idea is following : 
we have here and tonnenweise data , the information we have gesammelt on the transportation . 
we lock to believe , anzusprechen a good movie this way , this subject is ... ... gewählten deputy and politicians . 
so , we have asked us here' s what . 
if you could come and help us there ... ... and shows , like us maybe we can do that on the political level . 
that sounds like a good idea ... ... and I' m gonna look at me with what people off the best we talk about it . 
if we' re gonna make it at least ... ... it for her impossible to make to say that they know nothing about ... ... and their way to take a abzustreiten Kenntnis the Sachlage , the hindeutet in Engineering Geo- ... ... and on already laufende Aerosol- Sprühprogramme . 
at least it should be off to let right , " interesting in the district Kriminalität " ... with a few people Warnglocken . 
you have a lot of enemies to Washington . 
there bündelt up the whole power ... ... and the money . 
well , there it is safe people don' t want you to make this job . 
but I' m glad you' il ... ... you' il see what' s wrong . 
we were taking the facts to Washington DC there . we put the next gewählten Regierungsvertretern letter . 
according to the fifth Zusatzartikel the Constitution ... ... the United States of America ... ... one person life ... ... with or without estate may be taken a tight Gerichtsverfahren . 
the täglichen Sprühaktionen but , entziehen ALLEN Bürgern the States Vereinigen life , health , and freedom Unversehrtheit ... ... without vorheriges , tight Gerichtsverfahren . 
... ... than Repräsentant the citizens , the United States of the house to protect we want her to do it in her power air , and for us to erwirken a sofortigen Stop that Geo- Engineering Sprühungen ! 
no , not exist , it Rechtfertigung il be legal still in other way , the planet and his people to poison . 
we ask for us , Außerirdische come on the ground , maybe she down to land at the United Nations headquarters or maybe you choose a klügeren place ... ... anyway , we have to land she and give us a school . 
and this school Drehknöpfe has 2 : 
with a button that you can the temperature on the ground ... ... and with the second button the CO² Konzentration . 
you can tell you that himself , we' d be in that case , wars ... ... because we have no way to a couple of us where we sit on the regulator . 
no Weltordnungspolitik . . . . . . and different people have different come true , where they want to have the regulator . 
Sonneneinstrahlungs- Manipulation s like Chemotherapie : 
nobody they want ! 
but we all want to get another chance for the other side got it to make and the risks to understand ... ... we should be to suffer in the crabs on a dangerous situation . 
- how long does it take up there ? 
- years , a couple of years ... 
- and then what ? 
it' s raining down ? 
- yes , that is correct . 
- don' t schädlichen Nebenwirkungen , of which she know ? 
- what we ask us , this always Unbekannte of the we don' t know is . 
- I understand . 
if they think of Versauerung , it' s no problem . 
there' s some Studien , the belegen that . 
but here' s the concern of course , that with so little research ... ... ... maybe a s not familiar - us - Unbekanntes out of the blue , and makes us . 
my name is Mike Murphy . 
I' m Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we treat a subject with the name " Geo- Engineering . " 
we had a fast question the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
I' m afraid I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
we have asked us , if they auszubringen support the theories the Klimawissenschaftler ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere ? 
- I should really have first Informationsmaterial before I my opinion ... 
- no problem . you know the subject ? 
- no , not fully ... 
- Überhaupt - no ? 
here a letter from Wählern s the people are concerned . 
- what are you ... 
- we dokumentieren the Geschehnisse . 
- well , I don' t know . 
you have to be a Legitimation here ? 
- yes , we are . 
we' re also in the Security- Check through . - ... ... Creator of our 
- well , I don' t think so . 
- please you don' t touch me ! 
- you' re lying ... ... it ! - no , do we don' t . 
we should have lied about what ? 
- no , INDlSTlNCTLY ] [ ... 
- what are we have lied to the court ? 
that was a little strange yeah , right ? 
- I' ve heard no , no , no , nothing about it . 
- okay 
and it looks like out , so if this Programme are already . 
I don' t have carefully to me with this ... ... let me take a look at you ? 
- I can' t like to do that . 
you know ... 
- actually , I have to go ... 
- we can talk to her ? 
- yes ? ... 
no ... 
you let me get that . 
I' il look at it to me . 
I' il watch this deal ... ... and then help . 
- Herr General ! 
this program . . . . . . Geheim- open this program , Aerosol - Sprühprogramm , " Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering " ( SAG ) ( , SAG= Stratosphärische Aerosol- Sprühungen ] 
- what ? - in the sky bins Aluminium sprühen ... 
- I have no idea what you' re talking about . 
- okay . 
- it' s called " üblicherweise Chemtrails " ... Sir ? 
- come on , hurry it up . 
- when you were the Director of NIMA * , you' ve seen the Aerosol- flick ? ( Nima = National Imagery and Mapping Agency ) - no . 
Mike Murphy , Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we hear the subject , " " Geo- Engineering ... ... and we wanted to know if you support the theories the Klimawissenschaftler ? 
- Congressman ? 
- hello , people . 
we wanted to know auszubringen , if you support the theories the Klimawissenschaftler ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere ? 
- I' m not familiar with it . 
- I beg your pardon ? 
- I don' t know what to see you there . 
- I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
- okay . - put the question in my office ... 
I' m not Anhänger ... 
I don' t have carefully it to me ... ... right . 
- I didn' t ... 
- did you hear about the subject , because it' s ... ... a public statement now , in the mass media come in and re going to discuss Kongress- Kommitees about this Programme . 
I think before we get something in the atmosphere before we should know the effects , isn' t it ? 
- yeah ! 
- and if we don' t know what it' s effects , we shouldn' t do it . 
I think we have four ways if we think about the choice of Geo- Engineering . 
the first is : 
we verbieten it easy ! 
I' d argumentieren that shouldn' t you be ... ... on the basis for little Studien to restriktiv ... ... that it' d better put the hands of science . 
I think durchzuführen the community scientific Versuche in kleinem Maßstab in this area ... " " ... and it is a scientific question is , what should be just this area " ... ... " 
it wasn' t give too much Beaufsichtigung and Beschränkung ... 
Mr. politician ? 
you will forgive ... 
I' m treat Mike Murphy of L. A. We the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
these people out run of this Geo- Engineering thing . 
I wonder why ? 
- I gotta talk to my Mitarbeitern about it . 
I don' t know the details . 
- somebody did you been on this subject s kind do ? - , sir ? 
, Mr. politician has anyone ever been talking to you about the subject Geo- Engineering last November ? 
you' re a Befürworter this theories ? 
we' d give you like to papers about it . 
- about what ? - Geo- Engineering ? 
you know nothing about the subject Geo- Engineering ? 
never heard of it . no . 
that some of the I never heard . 
today in heaven when we say , we' re already have seen that . 
- you have never heard of Geo- Engineering ? 
- no . 
noisy to shoot the theories 10 million tons Metalle in the air . 
that Komitee science for and technology , it' s s the first time ... ... no ? 
- no , never heard of it . 
- well , we were very fond of me . 
- hi , how are you ? 
I' m fine . 
- well , what is it ? 
- we' ve spoken with the office of Kongressmitglied Watson ... ... and their Pressesprecherin , Fr White . . . . . . was familiar with the Gesetzesentwurf " space Preservation Act of Abgeordneten " Dennis Kucinich ... ... who has mention Chemtrails and Militarisierung and galaxy of the atmosphere ... ... later on , that was ausgeübt from the Gesetzesentwurf to streichen . . . . . . ... ... you' ve seen the Aerosol Sprühungen about the Capitol today ? 
- politician ? 
- I' il get to them later ... 
Geo- Engineering is there a tremendous Bandbreite to Unsicherheiten , ethische and political Bedenken ... ... and the potential for katastrophale Nebenwirkungen on the Umwelt . 
he' s not the one , very often interviews , so there' s that . 
- well , you didn' t keep your breath on . 
... ... than Chairman of Komitees for Gerichtsbarkeit I feel obliged to anzustoßen me a public argument about it and anzulegen a report/ ratio about Geo- Engineering . 
we want to know if you' re a Unterstützer the Maßnamen , 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... 
- to sprühen no ! - ... ... in the atmosphere ? 
- no ! 
I think we need more research . 
okay . 
and aktuellen about the bid ? 
there' s a mountain linear to Beweisen , the nachweist believe - how many people - that this Programme re already in the bid . 
- you know anything about that ? 
- no . 
it' s not safe here to Beweisen mountain . 
but I unterstütze research towards Geo- Engineering and besides , I unterstütze it , anzudenken a internationale administration whose . 
everybody who has examined know that ... 
I think that radikale theories are this , and I hope we don' t have to use it ... ... but it might get the time of the that we are forced . 
if we could vorlegen you proof the walk belegen that this Programme re already go and JETZT you' d take this ... ... then a public statement to the language ? 
we had already 3 , 4 Meetings ... Sitzungen to this subject . 
we have angesprochen the a public statement . 
well , not the theories , but the aktuelle to this Programme . 
I unterstütze aktuellen the mission' s not . 
I think we need more research . 
the consequences could have the hinausgehen about a country ... ... and I think we should s too the question the guidance . 
... while a subject of Einsatzes s not just , but VOR the bid ... ... especially in Hinblick on großangelegte Feldversuche . 
I want to give it will be seen to speak with this subject generell and I don' t like about world- Reglemente . 
when these people started , about the Notwendigkeit a Aufsicht through the United Nations Security Council to talk ... ... a national Umweltsicherheits- Behörde über- with a strong Mandat the United Nations ... 
it' s all right , that she looking for a years of world power to the Manipulation Umwelt . 
but I think it' il have to be a sort of lash internationaler contract , all the nation in a common destiny . 
it' s a common destiny . 
unfortunately , it' s not just the big know this could do that . 
I know this little . 
or maybe Milliardäre ... ... who say , " I' il save the world , alone , and I' m not to mention the trouble , that too . " 
how we determine when we have a world- Notsituation ? 
whose is at hand Thermostat ? 
how we determine when we start with it ? 
aktuell we have no way to do this . 
and what if we have to start with it , and then a problem with technique or the angle , we can durchführen longer sodaß t it ? 
in a or two years , the Aerosole come from the atmosphere and the Temperaturen il go then much faster than now . 
it' s anzupassen this Veränderungsrate , the it makes us to us . 
so if we have begun once so , we will be forced it for long , durchzuführen long time ... ... basically without end in sight . 
Boeing would streben to tie after this profit , right ? 
I mean , there is to do a finanzielle angle that ? 
hmm , we' il see ... 
so , you wouldn' t talk to me for Boeing . 
- don' t mind is that ? 
- well , it' s what it is . 
but one day , when the United States decide to do this , they' re looking for a company that most needs the that can ... ... and she' d be aufgestellt of the assignment ... ... Boeing d rather have to il let him instead of Lockheed Martin . 
of course , we have the industrielle the basis , the country can I suppose around and Technologien big , beispielsweise Landesverteidigung , a challenge . 
and we' il do the both of Profitgründen than ... the service of the country . 
I think it would be really verheerend , if we have to answer to meet in a few years , that it has given it a Geheimprogramm and some government ... ... to to the Stillen what it' s like to bewerkstelligen . 
it' s pretty clear , that you can the planet cool , but they can and will can' t return the same Klima , started with the them . 
I' il take her to have - or sinnvoll - I don' t like it a lot for and Wider with the question is , vermindern to the risks the Klimaveränderung . 
I think how good have a lead have that it would be useful maybe , but we don' t exactly know ... 
but they don' t take it back , I' m sure to just demselben Klima , with the they have started . 
hierin are all himself einig . 
- do you think we have the bid to our in life ? 
- I' m saying : 
I hope not . 
- Al ? 
- I to say . 
I hope not . 
- I sure hope not . 
I can see that as a sort of Rettungsplan ... ... than you know ... ... ... ... maybe Emissionsreduktionen to s the to stop them . . . . . . auszulöschen ... ... but if they should , she' s coming gewissermaßen do what gewissermaßen the brig big Deiche to do is to try ... ... in case like a disaster . 
so I see these Optionen more than Katastrophen - Notfallplan and t like the way Verminderung the risks the täglichen Klimaveränderung . 
you would reach a Verminderung of Fleischkonsums befürworten than a way you target ? 
- ähh ... ... yes ! 
- how you doing , that we knock umzusetzen that ? 
you can' t ... I can' t ... 
it' s decide to her job , what is besteuert and don' t . 
obviously , if they want that you behavior change people , they give them Anreize or Abschreckungen for your behaviour ... 
- that' s the answer , they wanted to listen , Mr. Smith was sure . 
- if my time wasn' t just past . 
because literally putting on the world Aluminium and Barium Verseuchung will be found ... ... and you believe , it' s coming from this Programmen . 
see you tonight , over from the capital , it looks like Aerosole be ausgebracht . 
have you seen it ? 
- no , but I can see them . 
the James Bond script a rich bad planes , Moonpie aufsteigen to impfen to the Wolken . 
how can I help you ? 
- I' il talk to you about . 
you just call my office on . 
- okay , you know the subject ? 
- say , Termine what about the office . 
- you are a Befürworter this theories ? 
how are you say , pal ? 
- I ... I don' t know anything about this , and I' m late . 
- I have to a hearing . 
- okay , we' il give you a letter about it . 
- that' s a letter to her voters ... 
- I' il take that ! 
- that' s wonderful ! ... ... and a lot of people believe that this Programme are already , because massive Verseuchungen been found . 
- I don' t know what they do with these " Programme . " 
one , two words ... ... to Engineering - Geo- Programme . 
- understood Geo- Engineering . . . . . . hab´s ! 
which plane versprühen . 
so , what here' s what happened : 
people in the world find Verseuchungen ... 
- I' il take care of it . 
I speak with them when I get back . 
- thank you . 
we see that we can communication , even if the Durchschnittstemperatur about right , re gonna change the opposite Niederschlagsmuster but today . 
some places to be warmer a little and some going places . 
well , it will give winner and loser , with this Geo- Engineering activity , if we make it ... ... but nichtsdestotrotz , like David already said : 
there' s reasons why should we leave it in Betracht . 
a lot of people are troubled about it , hard for the Giftigkeit of Aluminium what was angesprochen do in several Komitees on . 
they' d throw please a look at this letter of some your voters of this Bedenken anspricht . 
- excuse me , I have to go ... 
- okay , I can give you a letter from Wählern . 
you know of the Vorschlägen about that Versprühen ... 
- I' m a little late . 
- I see . 
thank you . 
well , I don' t know about that bescheid , so I don' t know what to do . 
okay . 
so the Geo- Ingenieure about to get hit , Aluminium and Barium in the atmosphere ... 
why would you do that ? 
Aluminium a metal wertvolles we can use . 
so cool , that would explain to target it' s the planet , it' s quite ... 
sounds strange . 
- that' s right . 
so , before they hit this Metalle in the air too little bubbles in principle , abzuhalten to the Sonnenstrahlung ... 
we' re here to find out what the Kongressmitglieder ... 
- I hope we have to do a serious hearing about it before we us decide that . 
- I hope it ! ... ... and there' s ausreichende have a lead , the andeuten not only that , this Programme re already in the bid ... ... because we find Aluminium - and Barium- Verunreinigungen in the rain , snow and floor . 
- okay , thanks ! 
- thank you . 
L. A. County s verzeichnet a hundred percent - igen Anstieg with Alzheimer- occasions in the past decade . 
many reason - and Wasserproben show high on values Aluminium in the entire Bundesstaat . 
why don' t you give me all the information , they have . 
I have some very good , the workers I' m beauftragen it . 
- and if you go to Mr. Lavelle ... 
- okay ... 
he' s my card . . . . . . you' il send me a Email and we ... 
we stay in contact . 
we' re checking the and as a mountain of Hinweisen , the nahelegen that Programme literally putting this is ... 
schieben give us the mountain over there and we shall watch us that ... 
- lf you see in the sky , you' il win some ... 
- okay ... 
you' il ! 
you can be quite see how this Aerosole versprüht of the aircraft ... 
well , thank you very much . 
the future of humanity off are a lot of us . 
we count on people like you ... ... take the a few Initiativen . 
thank you , thank you , guys ! 
- all right ! 
thank you . 
a lot of Kongressmitglieder s runtergelaufen the lead out and has been looking for auszuweichen in the doors Gängen to the questions ... 
well , obviously the war is against all of us , and we' re all in a Geisellage ... 
, people an oath schworen hochzuhalten , the Constitution and defend don' t know is that happens this , but beteiligen even get it . 
and we all have vorzutreten the duty and our mind to say . 
why the water is verseucht ? 
why is the earth verseucht ? 
why go at the sickness , move in with Aluminium context and betroffen do us all ? 
and so , we have vorzutreten all the duty and auszusprechen us to informieren and this here to stop , in our own and the terms of our children . 
this entscheidender a moment in the history of the world is ! 
we men have to decide us , if we want to live on our knees ... ... while we' re besprüht every day , and envenomed ... ... and live under ständiger threat or if we get up and free ... ... when people streben after the truth , justice , peace and freedom of all . ALLE God' s children to live ! 
as you can see , we finish our movie here in Washington DC . 
we have many hingewiesen Regierungsbeamte on this . 
have either of the abgestritten every Kenntnis ... ... or were just not ready to speak with us about the situation . 
now , as you can see , that' s behind the White House ... ... we have the Aerosole . 
that' s Sprühen weitergegangen . 
what' s the answer ? 
the answer is in Washington , DC ? 
there is no doubt . 
that' s the solutions is a solution , but it' s not just here . 
the answer is in DIR ! 
this subject concerning all of us deeply . 
so , look in your Innerstes . 
please , will operational . 
in you . 
catch it at weiterzusagen with steigendem Bewußtsein . 
we think the people that are over 90 % in Unkenntnis ... ... and that means that 90 % of the people who would do normally do something ... ... if she' d know it , but nothing , because they are nichtsahnend . 
so , look at your heart . 
use your choices , what they' re even after the message to are . 
the future of humanity is out of it .

why should I ? 
there' s always some shit . 
miss Lunt fired the Musiklehrer , komplette get off the band and all have to talk to worry about it .
