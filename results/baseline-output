- German WITWATS Subtitles version of 1 05 ( 2010- 12- 07 09 : 15 : 
could it be that a strange Substanz , found of a man in Südwesten from Arkansas , one part of the test government is ? 
that is the question rund for a phenomenon called " Chemtrails " neuerdings attention , the big erregt . 
they say the government versprüht Chemikalien about us to the weather to controI and to change . 
and they say the ungewöhnlichen Kondensstreifen in heaven , re in a Chemikalien- beladene " Chemtrails . " 
people say , the government versprüht up there , Chemikalien to the weather to change and to manipulieren ... ... and leave in there and see what you call it " a " Chemtrail . 
well , if there hinsehe and I think that' s Kondensstreifen , tell me that are " Chemtrails " ? 
yes ! 
a Kondensstreifen himself had already aufgelöst . 
that' s interesting , Christina . 
this subject interests so not just in this country , but also in the European countries ... ... actually , the whole world . . . . . . are a lot of people on this subject interests ! 
Dave , you' ve mentioned that Klimaforscher and the other , the atmosphere were believe ... ... that she must be any sign of this , ominösen Komplotts would recognize . 
our journey started in San Diego , California , where' s tausende scientists , Ingenieure , political Entscheidungsträger and Journalisten ... ... to the American " Association for Advancement of the Science " - conference met . . . . . . . . . . . . ( AAAS=Amerik company for wissenschaftl . 
one of the themes was the künstliche Beeinflussung of Erdklimas , even called " Geo- Engineering . " 
during the conference scientists talking about the " Plausibilität " the Durchführung weltweiter Klimaveränderungs- Projekte ... ... under the cloak " Verhinderung the Erderwärmung . " 
a theory that breite Akzeptanz enjoy , beats in " ETWAS " in the atmosphere to sprühen . 
when scientists to already laufenden Aerosol - Sprühprogrammen ask , they were erklärten ausdrücklich that t ever been umgesetzt derartigen Programme . 
but oddly enough entsprachen those theories the same ... ... what people rund the world to say that now already happened . 
when I heard that the American " Association for Advancement of the Science " - conference abgehalten here , will you ... ... and stolen a large portion of the themes to Engineering Geo- ... I just had to come . 
I had to be there . 
I had to hear what this Klimaveränderungs- top scientists have to say . 
... ... to the other question to Chemtrails " " and Wettermanipulationen ... ... already eingesetzt now , without our know . 
I didn' t see them here personal , but ... ... I even in Regierungsämtern ve worked ... ... in a high Ebenen at the White House and the Landesregierung . 
I personally , there' d be more skeptisch ... ... but to be honest with you . 
" you can' t know what you don' t know . " 
Chemtrails ! 
the Internet they' re as evidence for angegeben that the government künstliche Wolken erzeugt to the Erderwärmung entgegenzuwirken . 
you claim that the American government with more Duldung the national government ... ... in Geheimen planes verwendet to Ballungszentren ... ... with Aluminium , Barium and Strontium to besprühen ... ... to the Bedürfnislosigkeit ? ) ( the people and so the Weltbevölkerung to your airspeed as indicated . 
I' m always a little skeptisch , because I have the government ... ... not capable , Appears soetwas in such a big Umfang to do . 
that' s not rain , this is no time . 
believe it or not , Sie´s 
Militärflugzeuge versprühen in this Region , " Chaff " ! ( dt . " " Düppel = Radartäuschkörper ] 
little Aluminiumteilchen , sometimes they are of the plastic or even metallbeschichtete Papierstücke ! 
you are to resist Radar- and obviously trainieren the . 
so , they wouldn' t admit it , but I was many years Marinesoldat ... ... and tell them that easy . 
what' s happening here . 
Militärflugzeuge , some come from Key West Airforce the base , and he' ... ... get in the atmosphere up and throw Polyester- stripes up , some are a little breiter ... ... other once house from Fiberglas , ummantelt with Aluminium . 
the Air Force kicks these things from her aircraft ... ... the fall to the floor ... ... then , sometimes what a all day before . 
this is unweigerlich or military ... ... what goes on here ... ... the government the Air Force ... 
if they such paragon see ... ... you can be sure . 
there' s something up . 
that is so little fine , magnetische ... tiny- little stripes ... ... from either Aluminium ... 
it' s a offence find out what' s really and don' t . 
but it looks like , so if this is a lebensrettende Massnahme of Militärs . 
that augenscheinliche motive behind this Verschwörungstheorie " is . " 
a Weltregierung ( Stimmengewirr : quiet in the hall ! 
order in the hall ! 
I can' t hear nothing . 
Mr Chairman ! 
I want this house versichern that both my Ministerium than my Amtskollege the Gesundheitsminister an hour for correspondence ... ... to this subject will have the different that this Verschwörungstheorie t ... ... a Körnchen gives you the truth , and beobachteten stripes ... ... just the planes from the Triebwerken stammen . 
order ! ... ... and I think that this anschauliches an example for the new Sprecherin Labour the party ... ... that she Verschwörungstheorien about the U. S. government is out . 
- order ! 
it' s called " Geo- Engineering . " 
the Erderwärmung fight by killing chemischen dust in the atmosphere get and so schädliche Strahlung into space reflektiert . 
our Definition of Geo- Engineering " is . " 
bewusste , großflächige procedures in the system ) - ( Klima the earth . 
a Bandbreite of plans to Klimaveränderung was diskutiert . 
a klassisches instance s the Einbringung of reflektierenden particles in the Erdumlaufbahn . 
on the other hand , could give it some good reasons about Aluminium think sometimes . 
put it out that it is a work of the Umweltverträglichkeit of Aluminium in the Stratosphäre . 
the big thing is that Aluminium a 4- even bigger Volumenstrom in little Partikeln s like sulfur . . . . . . . and that is that we have a 4- d surface for the same Strahlungsantrieb have . 
we have a 16- about fach kleineren Koagulationsfaktor ... ( Partikelverlust through Zusammenschluß to great P. ) / time ... ... and that bewirkt really a Verminderung . 
it looks like we with a geringeren Mengen auskommen . 
and that' s the reason in the Hughes Aircraft Patenten out of the year 1989 ... ... of Aluminium the speech . 
and that' s why we find Aluminium in Wasserproben , they were on to the surface . 
and here we have David Keith ... ... who says Aluminium has a 4- even bigger Strahlungsantrieb . 
so , they want that we think it' s about sulfur , but ... ... they have to verplappert and rausgelassen ... ... that Aluminium four times a better s for their targets to reach ... ... and it looks like when she didn' t know that we the effects whose know . 
that little this is a picture of study about Nanopartikel - Fertigung the show , that you qualitativ very hochwertige ... ... what a plane is ... ... very simple qualitativ hochwertige Aluminiumpartikel make some , just by killing Aluminiumdampf sprüht , the oxidiert . 
so it' s backing possible and there' s already a breite Literatur , the to get busy . 
and you can do that , either by a new planes , or is the bestehenden umrüstet ... 
well , there' s a couple of ideas ... 
ask you to a Technologie- company on , if you can umsetzen ... ... and they' re not gonna say , that is very complicated . 
they' il tell you : yes , we can do that ! 
it looks like Klimaveränderung through Aerosole Sprühpartikel ) ( sound so cheap ... ... that expenses don' t even have a ' will be . 
this is the Umsetzung s a risk of Risiko- call off . 
that' s a chance to do it to the chance to do . 
and it' s the problem , we like it , and verwalten grundlegend harder than any different . 
well , I' m telling you , it' s cheap Stoffe in the Stratosphäre to get and I' m convinced that that' s right . 
I don' t want to change that will . 
but I believe we ever more weiterforschen the less s just the thing look ... ... the complicated to the effects of the Umwelt look . 
that' s it ! 
because right now , it looks easy to get out ! 
so , I think if we more forschen to find out that this is probably harder and komplizierter s than we thought ... ... and that the Nebenwirkungen difficult to managen are . 
and that' s a healthy , this is the result Management easier will do . 
of course , is the reaction gegenteilige possible . 
it' s a empirische ( =erfahrungsbasierte question : what people really that is what are these when she plans to find out . 
another reaction would be example : 
if this , scientists so worried about it , CO² re too little bubbles in the atmosphere ... ... and that would really mean that we with us in the risk of CO² in the atmosphere auseinandersetzen should . 
and by the way , it' s not really a moral danger . 
it' s more like Trittbrettfahren on our expenses times a grandma . 
aktuelle Studien about the Luftqualität , u. a. from California Air Quality Resource Board ... ... to know that stayed in little Partikel especially For for the Atemwege be . 
during all the argument today , I haven' t heard about this Erwähnung Fall- out ... ... is that ... ... and have been on the one so hochreaktiven Metalls like Aluminium to Vergiftung of ground and Grundwasser . 
the question is , what the effects of Materialien on the human bless you were when they from the Stratosphäre herunterkommen ... ... in the little special Aluminiumpartikel . 
my study , Aerosol- elements of the people of the university , Carnegie Mellon have the effects of the human health ... ... ... and though we don' t have veröffentlich , this was the first what we' ve done ... ... to the Größenordnungen to berechnen , not with pencil and paper , but ... ... with a Gesundheitsauswirkungen for an expert on people , if it' s a could be . 
so , to Aluminium or else Partikel , there' s a lot of toxologischer aspects , of course , the you must watch yourself right . 
but naturally , considering the enormen number of Partikeln and the Gesundheitsauswirkungen this little particles ... is the right answer ... ... what we haven' t been released yet , but this was first what we have examined - some führende an expert ... ... the epidemiologische in to do research on health , say that t even in Ansatz a subject is . 
let me again s : 10 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere versprüht , don' t have effects of the human health ? 
here , let me be careful . 
we separate the question of Giftigkeit ... ... so , we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and t been released yet . 
so , we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and t been released yet . 
we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and t been released yet . 
Dane saw in on and said , 
so , you tell me that Versprühen of 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... ... no effects of the human had health ? 
he holte deep breath , schluckte , and he said : 
here , let me be careful . 
we don' t have serious Studien Aluminium to do , so it could be that we in a dreadful thing to what we don' t have bethought . 
and that was for me the just so , what about the public gelangen will be : 
it' s the schädigenden physics of Aluminium , the in the world be step on the panel . 
and this is David Keith with this subject konfrontiert right there , and he looks so if she now the cat from the bag could' ve left ! 
we don' t have serious Studien Aluminium to do , so it could be that we in a dreadful thing to what we don' t have bethought . 
so they' re on , because the evidence and the Agenda re separated from this Klimaerwärmung try to help . 
obviously there are even some other targets . 
if Bevölkerungsreduktion , control , Waffen- aspects , of course , Telekommunikation ... 
all möglichen things about the genaues we don' t know . 
we know it' s not really , and I don' t even mutmaßen , what exactly are these targets ... ... but one thing we can see all right . 
these things are not ... These things are not vorteilhaft for humanity . 
it supporting the intention of Elite . 
so , I think the question' s , where we' re moving the Trennlinie between ... ... Aktivitäten , the don' t mind re and globale don' t need ... and Aktivitäten , the on a globale ... benötigen . 
Dr. Holdren s ready to explain the president' s in terms science and technology and ... ... than director of the science for offices and technique strategy OSTP ) - ( available to stand . 
I look forward to his weisen Beirat the coming in years . 
my personal opinion is , we have to Engineering Geo- on the table leave . 
we have to look at this very carefully , because we could desperate enough il be einzusetzen about it . 
what would I do , if we in the year 2040 or 2060 a dramatic Klimakrise have ? 
with , let' s say , weitreichenden Hungersnöten or Grünland that suddenly the sea versinkt ... ... and annehmbare the only way we can start , the earth abzukühlen ... ... would be a direct surgery in the Klimasystem , beispielsweise by we Partikel in the Stratosphäre einbringen . 
of course , do we always have any things in the Stratosphäre . . . . . . so it' s not like that the Stratosphäre untouched was absolutely . 
but we don' t want any people off . and do the things , a big Strahlungsantrieb have ... ... or about a big longer Zeitraum Mengen to reaktionsfreudigem material einbringen ... ... what a erheblichen of damage on the Ozonschicht to follow could have . 
you know , maybe I' il bring Partikel in the atmosphere a because I' m trying to to make some money . . . . . . or I' il take Partikel in the atmosphere a to scientific research to an and try to the Wolken- physics to understand ... I take Partikel in the atmosphere a because I try to keep it in definite Regionen rain to leave ... ... and the Wolken to impfen and so more time in our Schipisten to do . 
and that he of course , many questions on . it' s üblicherweise risikoreich . 
it' s probably on some people have a negativen Effekt ... ... but we could us in a situation find them in the it pays off these risks to us to take . 
one of the things that really me re all in shock was the match the risks Vorteile and this Programme . 
so , the Vorteile : 
that was an element Abkühlen of the planet . 
some of the risks called were Ozonloch , droughts in Africa and Asia . 
I can you say : 
after I four days that scientists have been listening . . . . . . for four days Symposium ... ... I' m really worried because right now , that she rechtfertigen , rationalisieren and try ... ... a few really , really terrible , effects more Auswirklungen on our Umwelt to rechtfertigen . 
and basically formulieren the Verkaufsstrategie , the Umsetzungs and administration ... ... and the Finanzierungsstrategie . 
go to San Diego , I was like all in shock of this Programmen that I mean , I was about to write . 
after the Fertigstellung of Artikels in the night , sendete I this Internet- a magazine , with my Emailadresse angefügt . 
the next morning was my Email- Posteingang überschwemmt with Rückmeldungen of the world . 
why ? 
because I Aluminium in context with Geo- Engineering- Modellen ve mentioned ... ... and then didn' t know that so many people are information about it . 
well , it' s but so , that metal - Aluminium - in big Mengen , far beyond more normal values , everywhere in the rain , ground and snow will be found . 
in the follow strömten calls , the people of a desperate someone didn' , the thing that recherchiert . 
that was for the tip- off of that movie . 
before we started to filmen , we had the chance us with one of our geschätztesten Autoren and Dokumentarier , G Edward Griffin ... ... to meet to find out what he knew about the subject . 
I want a moment about a subject to talk , this always more attention to get himself . 
this subject , that' s exactly scientific " Stratospherisches Aerosol Geo- Engineering " mean , " " Chemtrail - phenomenon called . 
me , this is Kontroverse Chemtrail against Contrail Kondensstreifen ) ( very well of him . 
as I have to me befasst , that' s a klarer case . 
I have the Entwicklungen of Flugzeug- Verkehrs been watching his frühesten days . 
I wohnte in the corner of Flughafens in Los Angeles . 
I can me in the first Jets remember the there rape . 
boy , what did the for a noise . 
so we had a noise I never seen it happen . 
we got a lot to the end of the Landebahn and saw this Jets to like her , rape and abhoben ... ... because the for us a new was experience . 
I' ve been watching planes my life , and I know what Kondensstreifen are . 
I' ve been watching her . 
you house from verdampfter Feuchtigkeit , Eiskristalle , the in the atmosphere sucks will ... ... and then , verdampfen get out and shine soon as you can see . 
a plane is over , followed by a little white line right behind it ... ... and you ... ... about 10 or 20 Flugzeuglängen to it than that he' s gone ! 
by the way , you can do these today from time to time to study . 
" there is a Kondensstreifen ! " 
these other things , talk about the we' re all here , and not the same phenomenon . 
those planes flying over and this little bubbles white smoke out ... ... the whole of the sky Horizont until Horizont covers and s not even auflöst ! 
the question is : 
why ? 
I have my own Vermutungen , but I hope that a couple of good investigative Journalisten go out and get us the answer to my question ! 
I know , if always the thing herauskommt - and she will - the people do that will undoubtedly , say : 
" yeah , well ... we have it for EUCH done , guys ! " 
" it' s for the good of the Allgemeinheit ! " 
" it' s for the company . " free to the Klimaerwärmung to prevent . 
or maybe at the people against an attack with irgendeiner terrible Biowaffe to impfen . 
" we can' t rumlaufen and every one injection in the arm , but we' re besprühen and so they can save your life . 
you see , we are not as good ! 
" we do it for the good of the society . " 
I know , whatever it is , they' il say it' s for your own good ... ... and mine . 
get out before . 
if we could get another chance for the other side , to a Hurrican that and a s in New Orleans to meet . 
and we on , we could take him like that , that Mississippi instead , he scores ... ... where instead of a hundred ... ... so I' d more or less from 6 Mississippi to kill 1, 800 of New Orleans to save . 
and if you do that , aim you got there , would you 100 then these people murder ? 
here , there' s a lot of Rechtsfragen . 
it looks like , so if that Sprühen mostly in NATO countries s appearing . 
I have seen it here in the United States , I have seen it in England , I have seen it to Scotland ... 
I have seen it here in Canada , and I have reports of people from France . 
there' s a Gruppierung here . 
any amount of political Gruppierung - globalem . 
it' s not only one American phenomenon . 
it' s international and I think that this I' d like to examine your the fact that berücksichtigen should . 
you' re a political Gruppierung and POLITISCHES find a motive . 
but my opinion bescheidene hierzu : 
it' s no way to your or my health . 
I don' t know what it is , but we' il soon find out it ! 
I' m sure if you the old " Ratschlag follow the money " folgst ... ... you will sooner or later find the answer . 
quickly we have noticed that we need had the same , this information to issue . 
the public teilhaben let people let know what it' s done . 
Edward was a touch of this thing like that he suggested has to help us . 
so , the just so after that Budget everything seems ... ... it' s the deal now fertigzukriegen . 
and we don' t do this without any answers to . 
we' re not a scientist . 
we ask genaugenommen just questions . 
and we will be very skeptisch with the answers . 
that' s it on the point , Margie . 
why SEHEN people t it ? 
you don' t hear it . 
you know , I don' t know . 
you' il get the facts not on the table . 
you know , we got big luck ! 
look , what option us here in my lap like it is . 
( laughs ) ... way ! 
- yes , actually ... 
- yeah ! 
- it' il be a fight will . 
- a Herausforderung and a fight . . . . . . but why are we here ? 
- you' re now on ... 
- all right ! 
I saw the sky with a Zick- Zack- paragon of Chemtrails ! 
I don' t know whether more in L. A. or on the street , but I saw in heaven ... ... and thought . 
look at the on ! 
you are never that Flugrouten ! 
that was a Gitter ! 
a Gitter ! 
a regelrechtes Gitter about the city , and I traute my eyes ! 
- milchig , white Wolken ! 
now , what' s all very einleuchtend out . 
we have proof the Bodenproben with the Aluminium , Barium , Strontium ... ... and what we in the Patenten get and what the Klima- Ingenieure tell me what' s going to happen . 
for the Normalbürger that' s a Volltreffer ! 
this is a heikler wait for the herrschenden Mächte . 
because she a verdeckte operation like that " Troposphärische Aerosol program , " or " Chemtrails " ... ... " project Ikarus " or whatever . 
it had many in the name of the years . 
and she rather it around in a public , science Klimaveränderungs- Sonnen- , because the shield out of the Klimaerwärmung s rudder . 
so , right now is the belly of the beast right about us without schützende armour . 
I don' t care if the people of Chemtrails believe it or not , the thing frightful Klimamanipulations- should be enough . 
and if people about Geo- Engineering all know , re obviously , Chemtrails ... ... because it' s DASSELBE ! 
so , we' re talking about a WELTWEITE plot ? 
Klima- scientists have suggested the world to do . 
we' re on our way to Redding , California . 
that' s the second step to the AAAS- conference . 
we' il see what I can find . 
we' re here in northern it at the house of Wigington Dane . 
he has about 2, 000 morning country ( about 8 : km² with a look at Lake Shasta . 
he' s told me about the a challenge the them up here . 
let' s talk with Dane . 
we' il see what' s going on his Grundstück . 
we' il see what he that durchmacht and what Maßnahmen he shoots , he scores , and the Testergebnisse the he did . 
well , I' m from the Energiewirtschaft . 
I' m in the first Sonnenkraftwerken of the country , frühern in the ' 80s , worked . 
my house was on the cover of the world biggest Magazins for erneuerbare Energien . 
so , this is my Background . 
my goal is it , alarmieren to the public . 
a man of giftigem material herab re on us , point . 
about five years ago . our üblicherweise blue sky and now he' s full of Striche and Schleier ... ... and practically NICHTS what you in the Horizont in heaven and see is a natural cloud came on ! 
it' s actually all this Rückstände Flugzeug- lines with the to ausbreiten in Wolken , künstliche Wolken ... 
the sky looks like a dirty out ! 
no more white Wolken and blauer heaven , how have a few years ago . 
there they look like with huge Industrieaktivität or at Waldbränden . 
we see that typischerweise every night . 
even in the clear clarity Bodennähe is reduced ... ... we don' t know that , except at the days at ' em , we have these long , anhaltenden stripes ... ... to the ausdehnen and all the sky bedecken . 
in some days , you can even see how these lines with vertical abfallen , like a Schleier . 
we assume that , the particles absenken . . . . . . and we have the tests , the prove we want to be with Mengen Aluminiumpartikel überschwemmt ... ... the literally putting zehntausende times are higher than the ohnedies up angesetzten Grenzwerte . 
so , we don' t talk about a geringe prozentuelle Erhöhung this giftigen substances . 
we talk about Mengen ... beispielsweise of the side of that mountain Mt . 
Shasta ... 
when you get there , hinüberschwenken ... that' s a Wahrzeichen northern Kaliforniens , that' s when unberührtes Wasserreservoir . 
- our Aluminium Schneeprobe of a Hang of Mt . . . . . . Shasta was 61. 000 ppb . 
( parts which Billon=Teile a Milliarde=10- ³ ppm : . 
that' s gewöhnliches Schneewasser . 
and the people drink this stuff , if they the mountain besteigen . 
and remember : 
Amtshandlung is necessary on 1, 000 ppb . 
that' s 61- fach about the gesetzlichen Grenzwert and our climber giftige have a drink of water ... ... of Mount Shasta . 
Barium : 
eight- three , Strontium : 
383 
so in this summer , the people who bergsteigen have giftiges water . 
basically , taken away ! 
I don' t want to be 61. 000 gallons of Aluminium Mikrogramm a drink . 
and again , we have already the values pH- in this country to the ten to go in and see 12- fache can prove that clearly . 
it' s not suspicions . 
we can prove that clearly this Metalle were in the rain . 
we have mehrfache samples . 
Bakkalaureus the Naturwissenschaften , Internationale school for Forstwirtschaft in Missoula , Master ... ... in Zoologie , Spezialisierung on Wasserfauna ... ... thirty five years as Wildtier- Biologe for the US Forstverwaltung ... ... and a couple of years before Bodenschutz for the USDA Bodenschutz service . 
besides , I ran Botanik- Programme , grass - and Weideland- Programme ... ... and run this still . 
the moment I do a lot of Beratungstätigkeit for Meistergärtner . 
when I this garden ... in the year G have begun ... ... was that , pH balance here , 5, between 5 and 5, 6 . 
this is the old Bodengutachten . 
you can here , on this side ... ... my floor see . 
here at 125 investigation , 126 ... ... this is my house . 
and here , pH the Bodenreaktion ... ... should 4 . between 5 and 6, 0 are . 
and over here in the mud it' s even a little tan . 
here he is just 6, 8 . 
and what' s this with the shoots in Ökosystemen ? 
well , we' il make one of the things out and see us these little things ... ... on the floor . . . . . . in herumkrabbeln many times they don' t find any more . 
those little Gliederfüßer you hardly under the Mikroskop can see ... 
with the here , you can see the Bewegungen ... ... the little wee , mikroskopischen ... ... looks like , a little bewegende particles . 
this start to get out ! 
you are not a go , but they start to get out . 
this is Eicheln the Färbereiche ... 
this is Zedernholz ... 
come on , guys ! 
this should be mad pH- and the Messung one , of course , is worth 10 fach higher than expect ? 
something right here by terrific t ! 
- you look at those reports all . 
a lot . 
- that' s 20 reports of here . 
two twenty . 
I' d say , 20 more to the ... 
all show dangerous Mengen Aluminium ... ... and Barium ! 
the science says there' s something komisches ... ... and the whole Schwarzmaler say : 
well ? " and s a neutraler , pH balance not good ? " 
- no ! 
neutral s not good . 
neutral s not good . . . . . . if your ground , pH balance of a six , 5, should have then he should stay there , if you want to have a healthy anti- forest . . . . . . and if you want to have a healthy anti- garden , you should your , pH balance between 6, 0 . 5 and 6, beibehalten 
I think it' s necessary that we wake up and see what' s happening here ... ... because we can' t just ignore because it' s always worse and worsens ... ... if we' II ignore it on and verdrängen and just say : 
we had Einweckgläser , all the new , sterilisiert in the rain , which we have gesammelt . 
and we had a HEPA filter ) ( Schwebstofffilter , with the we have getestet the air . 
OK , so you have gesammelt rain and the air gefiltert . 
what did you find ? 
Aluminium and Barium . 
this is still a test the 375 000 ppb , Bryan . 
Barium at three . 090 , Strontium with 345 . 
yes . this is from a doppelwandigen pond . 
with EPDM- Dichtungsbahnen for Fischzucht . 
( EPDM = Ethylen- Propylen- Dien- Monomer- Kautschuk : there' s no Chemikalien or sonstige Stoffe in this Dichtungsbahnen , the in the water gelangen could . 
this poetry was developed for use this . 
the well , that was , the pond speist getestet and getestet again . 
no ! Aluminium nachweisbar zero ! 
the only other source , the pond this speisen can s Regenwasser . 
we' re here on a gefilterten Waldanhöhe . 
meilenweit away from jeglicher industry , interstate or like that . 
for a few days with heftiger Sprühaktivität we could see that s a movie on the Wasseroberfläche bildete . 
we' ve got this shift getestet and the result : Aluminium and Barium ! 
after a half years Ansammlung we had 375 000 ppb Aluminium it . 
that' s literally putting giftig ! 
we can clearly in that what we in the sky see the same like what , in diversen Patenten beschieben is ... ... and the Stoffe in Erdreich stimmen with which the Patente agree . 
this Stoffe were 5 years not here ! 
in this is a neuartiges Mengen this phenomenon . 
in some occasions a Anstieg percent of 50, 000 , in case of Aluminium . 
the of the primordial Messung of 7 ppb , what' s up , ohnedies was up for 50, 000 % in five years . 
we have tiefgreifende changes in this time seen . 
Dr. Lennard Thyme , doctor in really . I' ve done with him a Gegenprobe and he says that the Oxide of Aluminium , Barium and the Strontium , pH balance of ... ... one sauren down to a neutralen change . . . . . . there is no question . 
- well , that' s just ... - that' s exactly what you can keep an eye on ! 
- oh ... 
I' ve got a Doktortitel in anorganischer really from the ... ... State Oregon University , and ve worked with various Metallen and Oxidationszuständen . 
then I have a postal Doktorat at the university Brandeis done ... ... with the I on the Stabilisierung the company Oxidation Metalle ve worked . 
the target is find out like this in all that dynamische balance of life fügt . 
I have to Francis Mount up on Shasta worked and he told me some Regenwasser- analysis ... ... however , the way ... ... with Aluminium - , Barium - and Strontium- Werten in the atmosphere to do . 
so , I think the wesentliche Giftstoff in this Chemtrails is that Aluminium . 
the values , the of Mount Shasta we can keep an eye on , re completely unacceptable ! 
if we of Metallen in germ Systemen see , we don' t talk about Aluminium Massenware of the people think ... ... if they Dosenlimonaden and use such thing . 
if it again in the state Aluminiumoxid- übergegangen s out front now , it' s a shift in the Blutgefäßen and SCHALTET the LEBEN AB ! 
if elements , the don' t usually in the Umwelt are , for once in the neighbourhood eingebracht be bell a few proper Alarmglocken . 
Aluminium s most awkward in germ Systemen . 
it' s sit on , Moonpie t let go and nullifies the system on - and then war´s ! 
by the time you in of Aluminium ansammelt , that' s quite neurologische damage caused it ... ... because it' s like Aluminiumoxid ablagert there , in the principal and stay there in of normal t have dropped Over can be . 
the Gesundheitszustand of every people always has to a man named Maß with Giftstoffen to do ... ... and Aluminium is known for krebserregende physics have to . 
the Halbwertszeit beträgt Jahrzehnte ! 
I think we should work out of this Giftstoffe our Umwelt to okay , instead of more Gifte einzubringen . 
it' s very bedenklich that if we more Gifte zuführen , we the payments and the risks of cancer , higher . 
it' s so sad , that people think about it , Aluminium in the Umwelt einzubringen about something to bewerkstelligen and walk in great danger and anzurichten . 
wherever this Stoffe , come here , they' re here ! 
the on us herabregnenden Metalle bestreiten t let himself . 
that' s absolutely no Spekulation ! 
how already told have to the Metallmengen in the last four years to the Tausendfache increases ... ... and the line for Luftqualität in California has the of China herüberkommenden Aerosole here . 
Mike , the reason why I mean , I have primär this subject anzusprechen ... ... is the because I everybody else themes for zweitrangig hold . 
what could Dringlichkeit have a higher than not before the door re going to do ... ... and a Atemzug to get no air in Schwermetalle aufzusaugen ? 
if our Böden poisoned will , if our Gewässer poisoned will ... ... and then us what is left ? 
what we do always our time and energy aufwenden ... ... whatever our political shot , this is a salvage basis for all of us . 
we need to Atmen the air , not full of giftiger Chemikalien and Metalle is . 
we need water , this is not a verseucht of whatever those planes ablassen . 
people have stopped to consider that our atmosphere is so thin , like a Farbschicht on a basketball . 
it' s an extremely thin shift , the life on this planet possible . 
you just as Physiklabor to mißbrauchen and that to experiment till she' s beyond any saving ... ... is a stupidity of unglaublichem amount . 
if people would understand that this sort of forced ... ... not only JETZT happen , but ve been walking . geraumer time for 50 years has it countless Klima - and weather - Veränderungs- Programme given up the Kenntnis Großteils of a public a entziehen . 
and if they think that t say ... ... that she had kind of notice that soetwas s ... ... I would ask them things like " Agent Orange " ( Entlaubungsmittel in the war in Vietnam ) anzusehen and the other things do know this , because they have the power to say . 
because there' s no one who she is . 
because she these huge Militärmaschinerien have all the controI want and maybe ... ... they have I seen that document the government ... ... for verfügbar jenen , s online in the Internet , whose name is " Owning the weather " the property of the Wetters ( ! ) 
a erklärtes target our government . 
and not only our government . 
he has the Press Associated mitgeteilt that the American government " techniques that has to Wetterveränderung " ... ... so it for the new guy , " Weltordnung " possible , million Americans cold to leave and the rest to controI . 
to this Wettermanipulations- Methoden ... ... the entire Patente to gear 
Senator Clayborne Pell´s vollständige statement and his own Erzählung , not only that , this exist ... ... but it also verwendet we have zurückreichend to the Vietnam War . 
- we shall do all we can . 
- how are we , what can we do . 
you got the scientists behind you . 
scientists be with you , at least DIESER scientists s the matter with you ! 
- I don' t have a Millionen- Budget , but I' ve had enough to show that awful here something goes wrong . 
- all right ! 
then Arizona , the next Monday 21 . 
Senator Johnson to show Low . we' re so long with the car to be on my way . 
- it' s a pleasure to meet you . 
- we love it here . 
it' s so abgeschieden , so calm and out peaceful . 
my name is Karen Johnson . 
I was 12 years in Arizona Parlament of Bundesstaates . 
I was 8 years in Repräsentantenhaus ... ... and four years in Senat . 
if a plane überfliegt ... ... and the flick from the plane ... ... of , one end to the other of Horizonts s enough ... ... and starts to auszudehnen and wellenförmig more and more of the heavens to bedecken ... ... and ausbreitet to see it all the sky covered ! 
how could anyone just think that would be normal as that ? 
and then beneath to live and to know that the - whatever - it' s on a herabrieselt ... ... and animals on and on the ground ... ... so ... 
that' s frightful . 
and if people don' t really wake up soon , and the fact in the eye ahead ... ... that we have people , the awful things to do with us ... ... and we' d better wake up soon fight back , and us JETZT ! 
you know , I have 11 children . 
I' ve got five times a grandma . 
I have much to lose here ! 
I care , what is left for my kids stay ! 
it' s just me and I' m very fond of me , what is left for her stay . 
Aluminium s giftig . 
besides , we know that it is anhäuft . 
we know that we always more of this index . 
we take it about the air , we have a drink on it with our water ... ... and we can always more Mengen on . 
so , the idea that ... ... more Aluminium in our neighbourhood freigesetzt s in the way you have to describe how it' s very , very frightful ... ... and verstörend for us . 
those who issued of us , the Untersuchungen have done about it , re very worried about it that bad Allgemeinheit the information is ... ... and anyway , that it will be done about it . 
Aluminium s giftig ! 
we know that . 
you can gonna discuss it , what Giftmengen for the body is , schädigend ... ... but anbetracht the fact that it' s anhäuft ... ... is this erschwerend . 
the t worry about everything going on in there is beyond the Meßgrenze ! 
why is it don' t mind that we always besprüht be in the entire United States - on the whole WELT ? 
who pays for that ? 
so , the cases Alzheimer up like a Mondrakete ... ... obviously , what with the Anhäufung of Aluminium in the Gehirnzellen to do with . 
I think , in almost everybody is a family member to find that Alzheimer s under . 
and it' s a horrible ... ... a terrible affliction . 
and to say : 
" it' s just because the people Limonaden tins of from drink . " 
you know , my father died with Alzheimer and he has never been drinking Dosenlimonade explanation . . . . . . that doesn' t sound very einleuchtend for me . 
and so I ask me . 
how much did that Chemtrail- Sprühen , back in the neighbourhood of Illinois , geschädigt him ? 
a friend of us for 20 or 30 years in Arizona , Feuerwehrmann Pine ... ... and he says that this Waldbrände the today , they' re like a fight , heftiger , everything they have seen the opener . 
and when you' re around the Luftmessungen and those little easy , flammable Aluminiumpartikel looks at ... ... and that Magnesium on the trees ... ... that causes never dagewesene Waldbrände . 
here you can see . 
that' s split a million . 
you gave me this zugeschickt and I' m awfully find it interesting , because we just about two parts a million in our should have air . 
and it says here , we have 39 000 parts Aluminium . 
that' s a astronomischer worth ! 
the Barium- s worth up ! 
well , that' s beyond of good and bad ... ... what people should don' t breathe on her herabregnet . 
and the people to wonder that your health adrift , and she' s in the Notaufnahmen have to . 
why did she Atembeschwerden ? 
why get her Alzheimer ? 
it was planned ! 
we have such Eliten ... 
I don' t know how you want to call her . 
" one- Worlders , " " Illuminati " what I know ... 
as usual , you want to call her . 
these people see t worry about the Durchschnittsbürger ! 
you see , just to yourself , your greed , your power ... ... and if so 2/ 4/ 5 or three of us from this planet eliminieren ... ... s fine for these people ! 
because , then they have to don' t get more that' s why I soviele people herumzutreiben and to see . 
well , it' s a lot of the worum´s s here ! 
and it' s very , very alarmierend and frightful . 
so where' s that stuff from ? ... and WARUM ? 
why s gonna be a pass out that stuff out there ? 
so , I' ve heard so many explain . 
" yeah , we need to the planet cool ... " and this and this ... ... but when people trying to the planet cool , then why do you need such things in it ? 
the explain ve never very authentic for me geklungen . 
when I saw them my Equipment aufstellte , and he said to me : 
" the tree line here all die ! " ... and I said : 
please ? 
you said : 
" the tree line here all die ! " 
so , I thought well , I teste on Aluminium , because that' s one of the Hauptsachen Programmen in this is about the we here to talk ... ... and Titan ... ... so I took a sample of of a bark . . . . . . and she ran a program test on the result was positive with Aluminium and Titan . 
then when I started in California herumzureisen , I bemerkte the same everywhere . 
in Lake Tahoe were too many Rinden the same way to find in the whole region from Sacramento , and Davis ... ... everywhere where I was bemerkte I bark , that silber- white . 
I think this Chemikalien dringen in the floor a and destroy the roots ... ... and then if they aufsteigen , gelangen her in the bark of Baumes . 
these two over here , re just now ... 
so , does it hurt , watching like this ... ... look like they' re big and old ... 
we' ve probably 40 acres on trees lost our 10 country . 
every week , every second weekend , we see another , the tree starts to die . 
it' s just so sad . 
we just gonna cry . 
and used to think about the anything to do with that could have , together with the other explain ... ... would really dreadful frustrieren me ! 
if you always a tree down ... 
this is just not right . 
it' s just a sad one . 
and here' s another one over there in this little Baumgruppe . 
it' s better to and don' t get in waking up to fight in instead of a little leak to crawl and go to bed ? 
so ... UM GOTTES WILLEN , LEUTE ! 
your families s out there , your children are out there ... ... and your times a grandma ! 
I mean ... 
you MÜSST ETWAS TUN UM ZU HELFEN ! 
my greatest s hope to get people to Hinterfragen . . . . . . and if they not wake up , while there , I hope we are a few pflanzen able to seed . 
we' re the most place of the planet . 
Hawaii ... ... to the score the things to see and data to gather . 
thank you , that plane before are you with us . 
however , we hope that you could get a chance to enjoy the trip . 
we wish you a great vacation " or " welcome home , so happy if you' re here to live . 
the whole of the valley s autark . 
we have either Sonnen - , or Windenergie or Generatoren . 
- look at that ! 
- yes , such a loser , you can' t even ausdenken . 
- right , right ! 
even if you come from becomes here , this paradise here just now s going to be destroyed . 
you make it to the " Insel- method . " 
you make it out to sea , removed from the island . 
and so you see the planes Chemtrail- t . 
the theory that she is out on the sea , and ... 
- ... and so it comes in to us ! - ... and it KOMMT HEREIN ! 
these here come from west . 
and she sprühen today either of both sides at once . 
a lot of the stuff here is in fact of the Chemtrails out of this way . 
this Stoffe here ... ... they' il block off ! 
we should the Horizont can see ... ... there , where' s the earth krümmt . 
we' re up enough , we have the sea here , right ? 
we should Big Island " " can see . 
it' s just 30 miles away . 
and , as you can see , the job is not blauer heaven . 
this is the key ! 
that' s all , you know , it' s strange this blue ... ... flute of blue how I call it . 
and this is this a nice day . 
you know , there' s no more blue sky . 
we' il us today look at the stars . 
it' s like ... 
you' re gonna see . 
you can they ZÄHLEN ! 
so many nights to see the stars are now ! 
there should be hunderttausende stars , and you can they ZÄHLEN ! 
one here , a there ... ... a Planet here , it' s like ... 
sometimes you can see a hundred , in some other night only ZEHN ! 
this is what worries me . 
this stuff here . 
- that' s all WEICH ! 
- okay ... 
you can do this . just abziehen 
the bark , that doesn' t go ! 
I' ve never seen hunderttausende Kokosnüsse , but soetwas here ... ... they' re just break it up ! 
look at that , folks . 
soetwas I' ve ever seen . 
" in Big Island " I' ve always the trees gepflegt . 
something vergleichbares the here , as I have never seen . 
and that' s besorgniserregend for me . 
don' t easy , the task you' re here on the island . 
I could see the Skepsis because it' s beyond irgendeiner idea . 
it' s astonishing ! 
it' s amazing to go to the eyes of to look at other . 
in my eyes , I see that ... ... it' s like day and night . 
other people about it ... 
the illusion s derartig tiefgreifend ! 
what do you think would happen if everybody wakes up ... ... and can understand what' s wrong , what the plans ... ... that Klimaveränderer are ? 
I think ... I think I' d be a revolution give that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
if people really would understand what' s going on in there ... 
what are your Befürchtungen ... 
I know you love this country here ... 
what are your Befürchtungen ... ... ... to Chemtrails ? 
well , that we t live here anymore , and our own Lebensmittel anpflanzen can ... ... and that our health attacked will . 
- you think it' s already happened ? 
- yeah ! 
the fact is , that she make it every day ... every day . 
it' s a hämmern and hämmern ... ... and hämmern little tins of every day . 
and , of course , only gets it in the Umwelt . . . . . . and , of course , the shoots schwächt it . 
it needs a couple of years for it ... ... to the shoots to schwächen ... ... and then we ask for genveränderten Taro . 
then let' s ask for genveränderten Papaya ... ... because we our natürlichen seed anbauen can' t take it no more ! 
so we got a future ! 
we can' t really live here ... ... so , how God created us has to be . 
so talked me into it a Haaranalyse my friend of my daughter to do . 
so I got a couple of her hair Haaransatz , a few really new hair , and taken eingeschickt . 
I was so sure this is my hair a daughter unbelastet , through the Lebensweise , the we have here ... ... and from there , it came back and their charts were really up with Aluminium . 
this is the analysis . 
this is the Referenztabelle and this is the value my daughter . 
23, 1 with Aluminium . 
heaven is with a white fog covered and if I aufsehe night , I can , the stars very deep t see any more . . . . . . and I can' t different than me to do that thing with the health my daughter has to do . 
I don' t know where this Schwermetalle or come here . 
- look just like old she is . 
she was here abgeschottet . 
- here ! - and she' s ... 
I' d feel like this . 
this is this paradise ! 
- this child would be super- healthy as a horse ... 
- a ... ... place with biologischem Anbau ... 
- and here we have this whole Schwermetalle ! 
she has the höchsten chart at Aluminium ... ... and they had no Impfung , too . 
friends , these people play God ! 
you play God and manipulieren the weather ... ... and she sprühen stuff in heaven ! 
you' re trying to change ALLES künstlich , and your shoots , trees and even the sea ! 
so tonight , we hope that you instead of that to don' t mind ... ... anfangt you at that myself . 
because I really of my heart believe we have here is a crisis right ! 
really ! 
you hurt me in 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere obere einzubringen . 
what causes Aluminium ? 
that changes the Bodens , pH balance of ... ... and that' s giftig for the Vegetation ! 
besides , it is very giftig for the human health ! 
do the that really ? 
let me from my Erfahrungen tell and what we found . 
we have many have a lead , not the only assume so let ... ... but , like , I think prove that really these things happen . 
and as I promise , this is quite spezieller our guest : 
Michael J. Murphy , currently taking place of that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
he' s working on a Dokumentarfilm with the title : 
" what in the world are they ? " spraying ( what in all the world versprühen ) there ? 
Michael . welcome on camera . 
great tonight with you want to talk ! 
a friend of the other night ... ... he can see the usual things from another Blickwinkel out . 
he' s a little such a Verschwörungstheoretiker ... ... ... and he says , whenever the president to L. A. come on , there' s no Sprühen the whole week . 
have a better place for an interview ? 
look at that ! 
it' s really ! 
about our Farmen and stuff . 
so , basically they want your ability to unterbinden ... ... biological Lebensmittel to eat , clean and Lebensmittel bad water ... ... so , that looks kind of like ... ... for me , of course , it' s just a Prognose ... ... it' s hard for me to KONTROLLE ! 
" how we controI the masses . " 
how can Aluminium only be good for kind of a ... 
what was the second stuff you mentioned did ? 
- Barium ... 
- Barium and Aluminium . 
they' re obviously giftig ... ... for ALLES ! 
for the human health ... ... for people , for Farmen , for animals for ALLES ! 
- 61. 000 split a billion ... 
and behördlicher alarm should be at 1 , 000 ? 
at 1 , 000 ! 
and people drink this . 
the people who the mountain besteigen ... 
you drink this time . 
this is poison . 
oh , my God ! 
that' s grim . 
- well , that' s 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ? 
- that' s right . 
- 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ... 
I' ve spoken with friends in L. A. ... 
" oh , it' s just ice ! 
that' s Kondensation . " 
and I say : 
a Zweitklässler know , ice are not that and breitet to look ! 
you' re not expert , but a besorgter citizens , the said : 
" wait a minute , I want to ... " 
you recherchierst and that' s what we need to do as an American citizen ... ... and say : 
" you know what ? 
I want to know what' s going on here ! " 
I want to know what the Lebensmittelbehörde with my Lebensmitteln do . 
I want to know what the government with the air , the water is the floor ! 
it' s great , what you' re doing . 
my thanks to you , because you are light in this thing . 
let the whole Theorien Mason , really . 
what the Klima- Ingenieure suggest and what will find is spooky enough ! 
so , we can beschränken us on , all this point anzusprechen ! 
and I ermutige more people , vorzutreten and questions to ask ... do what he does ! 
thank you , Michael . thank you , thank you very much . 
Ausbringung of Aluminium- Aerosolen be affected everywhere . 
we have a magnificent , tropisches Klima , that' s how I think that might be in trouble . 
so , we' re not just come here and the news I think the people in the world found ... ... but , people ermutigen even after Aluminium , Strontium and Barium to test . 
basically , I think it was a wirkungsvolle trip . 
I' ve got a lot of people here in Hawaii , in Maui , wake up , see , not just curious , but , gewillt weiterzuforschen . . . . . . and this is my only option . 
I think it' s one of the mutigsten trains of Ed Griffin ... ... until now . 
it' s Tabu- the subject , no one should talk about it ... ... and it is Aerosol- Sprühungen ! 
we have tonnenweise dokumentierte Nachweise about Aerosol- Sprühaktionen . 
' it easy for me ! that Grundwesen of humanity was always in the sky and hinaufzusehen to ask : 
why ? 
no ! 
there' s no boundaries ! 
the room and the universe are endlos ! 
but now , in this 21st century we can' t do it any more ! 
everybody , the aufsieht and the huge Gitternetze and the X- e the sky looks ... ... until the of a or two Jahrzehnten no part of our Daseins were ... ... is declared aufeinmal for crazy ! 
and the people , the best and the biggest Verfechter are the freedom ... ... don' t want that you about , is it because they could get in Misskredit ! 
it appears as if there' s a whole Wirtschaftszweig built ... ... to the Steuerzahler to melken by a sort of weltweites Sprüh- raised s program ... ... for a lot of money with this project to scheffeln ... ... and it looks like she t go to see what could have effects for this . 
you do not find out whether or humanity that can survive like that . 
you want this stuff just hinaufkriegen there ... ... and DANN after we leave it that way , we' re to ... ... that it companies , there' s on the fuck happened to the Organismen profit ... ... the fuck happened to the seed , Getreidesamen changed ... ... to the Aluminium in the floor to resist getting . 
many Getreidearten grow not in such a area . 
so , after her up the Böden have ... ... to the peasants them to go ... ... and the seed buy , the gentechnisch changed for the Aluminium to resist getting that in the Böden was given . . . . . . and urplötzlich s all humanity abhängig of these other companies like Monsanto and this huge Agrarkonzerne . 
you can' t even more natural seed anbauen ! 
and we' il see about that . 
it' s a schockierende thing ! 
I hope we couldn' t hold on , that is true , but now ... ... indicates all that down ! 
we' ve got a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because H. A. R. P. A. [ high active Auroral Research Program : too hiermit in context could stand ... ... Geo- Engineering - how did you angemerkt - this in there' s a man named Dennis Kucinich´s Gesetzesvorlage ... ... the " space Preservation Act " often angeführt will ... ... the last I heard , not from was Congress - that was nice of ya . 
and then Key Bail- out - we like it here call - Kay Bailey Hutchinson ... ... the also a couple of law zusammengestellt has to Engineering Geo- in the power to sit ... ... something all of us , as I said , to the Klimaerwärmung save you . 
it' s a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because she look like so many Aspekten good through can move ! 
- Ed , so make them all , don´t you don' t ! 
- that' s it ! 
there' s this old proverb . 
" follow the money ! " that you üblicherweise the core of the Problems scores ... ... and for me , what' s it look like here just a ungemein profitable built s industry , rund ... ... to this concept " Geo- Engineering " or " Wettermanipulation " or " Reduzierung the Erderwärmung " ... ... and all the other things , the public ahnungslosen a pretty just can be sold . 
" oh , that' s all right . 
we want no Klimaerwärmung ... " ... and so do with it . 
and they don' t ask any questions , re not critical ... ... but in the Hinterzimmern can you see a whole building ... ... the industry s like I say , ungeheuer profitabel is ... ... and all the money ... ... comes from Steuerzahler ! 
it is a pretense a ! 
it' s still basically the ! 
and we focus on this one , that' s very easy to prove is : 
on the territory , there' s no Spekulation . 
you are definitely this Geo- through Engineering . 
definitely talk to you about it . 
you work at the Methoden for it . 
you work for the Strategien out . 
you have the Budget for it . 
everything is in position . 
we don' t need more aspects , of course anzusprechen to lock the case . 
well , they are people Theorien believe her . 
but at least they have to understand that it out of the question is , will want to discuss this . 
well , if they should , don' t be just as alarmiert , what about the plan is to do ? 
it can be proven that Barium and Aluminium and the other giftigen Metalle a very destructive damage on the planet and the people did . 
ain' t that enough ? 
how many aspects , of course , we have to reinquetschen there yet ? 
so if the planet is scheduled and the people to kill , we need more there some other reason to alarmiert to be ? 
" what in the world are they ? " spraying thank God , people think that question ! 
we don' t want any more . 
we only want to ask questions that can ! 
our good friend , G Edward Griffin . 
Mike , and Murphy and Paul Wittenberger ... ... to make this great with your help . 
that' s a Gemeinschaftsanstrengung to RICHTIGE information to the people to do . 
" what in the world are they ? " spraying a few more Abschlußworte before our time for ? 
the Abschluß betone I nocheinmal that we' ve got that question : 
" what in the world are they spraying ? " 
and now we WISSEN what it is . 
and people , it' s not like you ! 
I' m Vereeke Peter . 
I' il be out in Belgium . 
I' m 54th years old . 
I can' t believe it yourself . 
I' m a very happy and dankbarer man . 
we' il do the job , the police , that Justizministerium or the Umweltamt had to do . 
- and it' s very important that this Grassroots- a revolution ( of the basis ) will . 
- I think so too . - because we don' t GEGEN , but FÜR fight ! 
- yes , we fight FÜR ! 
I was 25 years in the selectmen and a Legislaturperiode as mayor . 
from this moment - 10 years ago - did everything begun to change . 
I started to get a picture of it , what really will have expired . 
I was completely clear that we - humanity - ... ... and ausgebeutet are fouled , keeps ... ... and since the centuries ! 
this phenomenon Chemtrail- made me mad because I was so helpless . 
you can decide which Lebensmittel you eat ... ... what you smoked , which water you drink ... ... which lives you live ... ... but not with this phenomenon . 
then you' re just a martyr ! 
it' s just a game . 
and it' s good to the boys and the bad guys . 
and the one we' re in position the matter of good to play ... ... the chance , the and the chance to have these Herausforderung überwinden . 
the three days , with the we brought them teilten , my heart , leap because it' s such a beautiful way to live . 
and so ... restful a way to live . 
at the departure , I ask me , as it there in 10 years look like . 
everything will be destroyed on her Grundstück ? 
and if so , what , then their Lebensgrundlage will be ? 
you' il have to let himself zertifizieren of irgendeiner company XYZ ? 
and what would the Voraussetzungen for it ? 
that' s the end of the freedom ! 
that worries me very ! 
very ! 
I' ve learned here' s what to say . 
" now , everything is so , what it' s like ... " " ... and everything' s going to be all right ! " 
- it' il be all right . 
- everything' s going to be all right . 
- yeah ! 
I have this tiefe feeling that we victorious il be at the end ... ... because we the right on our side . 
the Kosmos help us . 
and I have this strong feeling that we' re supporting of Wesenheiten ... ... and of the Mächten , we' re not even sure you can . 
well , for the first time we' ve got the record , wissenschaftlichen ... ... that we' re WIRKLICH besprüht . 
we' il besprüht ! 
it' s unbelievable and hard vorstellbar ... ... but we' re besprüht ! 
I think at this point , stehenzubleiben s no OPTION ! 
if you will know once and a tool like that and have a chance like this ... ... that Chemtrails- this thing or persistente Flugzeug- Kondensstreifen or as usual , you want to call ... ... that this phenomenon than REAL recognized il ! 
in a public Debatte ! 
the context with Geo- Engineering it' s five- vor- Zwölf , the to get to the public . 
so was the sky look . 
that' s old paintings . 
we have the forget , I' m afraid . 
in those years ... ... in which I a journalist in the Medizinforschung tätig was ... ... ... I have many , many things here . 
whatever ... ... I have always the same , I found three aspects , of course . 
we' il dümmer done ... ... we' re sick done ... ... and unfruchtbar we' re done . 
people from the world at or around this time ... ... down here in Belgium the first International Chemtrails- Symposium . 
that' s one führende Fachkräfte , politicians and Aktivisten hergeführt ... ... to Gesundheits - , Umwelt - and social aspects , of course , this Programme to discuss . 
it' s tonight , just to ... ... with the full facts , Goodspeed , documents , numbers , Patente , Lizenzen ... ... all leads us to the truth . 
we don' t have any other weapon against these huge Komplex ... ... than that Aufdecken this düsteren works in Lichte the truth . 
however , we hope that through our Anstrengungen more and more people to the fact ... ... recognise that we of our Führern hinters geführt will light . 
we' re today , when our family zusammengekommen ... ... to powers to join with the people here came to the world to show that Chemtrails no theory Verschwörungs- ... ... but a Verschwörungs- TATSACHE are ! 
from the university Technischen Delft , in Holland ... ... ladies and gentlemen , please , and you : 
Coen Vermeeren ! 
my name is Coen Vermeeren . 
I' m Professor at the university Technischen Delft . 
üblicherweise have the people in the sand , their heads ... ... in her own zwei- dimensionalen room and see t upstairs . 
if they do , but it will more and more room like this familiar . 
it' s me , too . was he playing ? 
I' ve got my students no explanation for this Phänomene give can . 
so I have myself examined her ... ... and had in that I could give them no answer . 
because I think that this phenomenon NATÜRLICH s not . 
what' s happening here not NATÜRLICH . 
and the explain that was given to us for me , re not zufriedenstellend . 
betrachtet you something from the wissenschaftlichen tone of he' s first step to try something to explain . 
I' m smart , my students re not quite so smart ... ... so I had to deliver them answers . 
but , if she most honest scientists a question , this must admit that they don' t have a say in it . 
if anybody Klima- Manipulation over our heads durchführt , then I wanna know ! I want the consequences know . 
I want the Gesundheitsrisiken know . 
I want to know all about it . 
when teacher at my university students my task I have the answers to deliver . 
and they have good questions ... ... on the I don' t have the answers ... 
- ... and I wanna know ! 
- fantastic ! 
and we' re gonna discuss it ! 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
for you here in Auditorium and for the world . 
Michael Murphy . 
thank you , thank you very much . 
it' s a great honor , here in Belgium to be ! 
people at the power controI all ! 
they controI the Märkte , they controI us ... ... and now they controI even the weather ! 
and she can use it for kriegerische sole purpose . 
the only thing they can' t controI ... ... is what God has profit : 
and that' s natürliches , biological Saatgut . 
the name is " hierfür Hegels Dialektik . " 
- problem reaction - ( solution to Hegel : 
- Antithese - Synthese ) These 
the problem is this huge Mengen Aluminium . 
everything begins abzusterben . 
the solution to come from , X , they said : 
" hey , guys ! 
get your shoots Erträge no ! " 
" all die ! " 
" but we have the solution . 
we have Saatgut , I am under your terms to grow ! " 
" it' s only one problem : 
now need you to buy MIR ! " 
we' re fond of me , that Agenda could be a part of this , all of course , and a biologic s abzutöten ... ... and to change on ! ... ... with genmanipuliertem Saatgut , it' s against Aluminium resistent . 
like some know , maybe we' ve just come back from a week Filmdreh in Hawaii ... ... it was a trip incredible . 
the people there are very worried because she keep an eye on that their Kokosnussbäume get sick . 
their Besorgnis is that this Programme a part of a great Agenda could be ... ... for all Natürliche , Organische to destroy . 
that in the end genveränderte Lebensmittel the Großkonzerne are her only Nahrungsquelle . 
I didn' t expecting that so many people , young and old ... ... on this phenomenon re interested ... ... and re worried about it . 
especially gave me the safety of the young girl like today ... ... only 17 and a speech of audience haltend . 
that' s incredible ! 
my name is Sophia Xenidis . 
I' m 5 years old . 
it' s creepy to know that the air , the we breathe , not that' s how it should be . 
that the Lebensmittel , the we eat , the water we drink , tracks this substances carries ... ... the about us versprüht be as if we were insects ! 
the feelings in the me auslöst are tiefe feelings of anger and violence ! 
I don' t want to be poisoned ! 
I don' t want to be krebserregenden Stoffen infiziert . 
it makes me so angry , that world- Vergiften , in a way , you always go on gigantischen amount ... ... and not enough s done to this crime Einhalt to gebieten . 
a klare answer to a question : 
we' il besprüht ? 
we were besprüht ? 
and it' s always the purpose us to keep besprühen ? 
what are we gonna do about it ? 
how are we gonna handle it ? 
how are we gonna stop it ? 
I know the answer to my question ! 
there' s only one person that can stop and you know who this is ! 
you BIST ES ! 
you BIST ES ! 
the person on the ve been waiting for you . 
we' re great , wonderful , a divine ! 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
sisters and brothers in here and Auditorium in the world ... 
thank you , thank you very much , that you were here with us here ! 
and now , enjoy yourself with this song ! 
hello ! 
good to see you ! 
come in ! 
I sure am glad you were good weather , until now . 
all right , move it back before we do in the winter . 
if you go to Washington , you could land on the snow . 
- thank God , we don' t do that ! 
- right , right ! 
you know , with this weather Veränderungsprogrammen - it' s strange . 
I think there' s something about 32 alone in the American Festland ! 
so , the theory is that Geo- Engineering too on with something Wetter- Manipulation to do with . 
that' s an interesting point , Mike ! 
it' s soviele Untergruppen with this subject Geo- Engineering connected . 
people my orders are to contact us all the time ... ... with the information to connections with Klimaerwärmung , connections with Wettermanipulation ... 
some people think you are , there' s a connection to the Morgellons- illness , at all . 
other again believe , it' s up to a method of the transmission elektro- magnetic Impulsen ... ... of H. A. R. P. A. Antennensystems up in Alaska and Sibirien . 
there' s one of the head of to humming and every one of ' seems to be worth investigation , but ... ... we have so little time . 
I think it' s smart for us , that we' il concentrate our efforts to the Sprühprogramme ... ... and the Giftigkeit this Chemikalien , and the destruction of the planet and the Gesundheitsschäden ! 
what we need more than the to the people to convince that we must stop this ? 
so , I think it' s important that we' il concentrate our efforts to it . 
Jeremy , we had an idea there ! 
we know that you know the system , political really good . 
the idea is following : 
we have here tonnenweise data and the information , we' re on our transportation gesammelt . 
we believe a good movie lock this way , if this subject with politicians ... ... gewählten deputy and anzusprechen . 
so , we have asked us here' s what . 
if you could come and help us there ... ... and shows , we might as the political on the level can do . 
that sounds like a good idea ... ... and I' m gonna look at me , with what people we' il talk about it best . 
if we should at least do it for her ... ... to make impossible to say that they know nothing about ... ... and their way to take a Kenntnis the Sachlage abzustreiten , the Geo- in Engineering hindeutet ... ... and on already laufende Aerosol- Sprühprogramme . 
at least it' s rather interesting in the Kriminalität " " District ... ... with a few people Warnglocken off to leave . 
you have a lot of enemies to Washington . 
there bündelt up the whole power ... ... and the money . 
well , that' s sure people don' t want you to make this job . 
but I' m glad you' il ... ... you' il see what' s wrong . 
we were taking the facts to Washington DC there . we put the next gewählten Regierungsvertretern letter . 
according to the fifth Zusatzartikel the Constitution ... ... the United States of America ... ... one person to life ... ... with or property without a tight Gerichtsverfahren be taken away . 
the täglichen Sprühaktionen but , entziehen ALLEN Bürgern the States Vereinigen life , health , and freedom Unversehrtheit ... ... without vorheriges , tight Gerichtsverfahren . 
when the Repräsentant citizens , the United States of America ... ... we house on that they all power in the air , do for us to protect and a sofortigen Stop that Geo- to Engineering Sprühungen erwirken ! 
no , not exist , it Rechtfertigung il be legal still in other way , the planet and his people to poison . 
we ask us to Außerirdische come on the ground , maybe down to land she headquarters at the United Nations or maybe you choose a klügeren place ... ... anyway , let' s get to it and to land give us a school . 
and this school Drehknöpfe has 2 : 
with a button you can the temperature on the ground that ... ... and with the second button the CO² Konzentration . 
can you imagine that we for that would lead a case of wars ... ... because we have no way to us to negotiate , where we the regulator sit down . 
no Weltordnungspolitik . . . . . . and different people have different come true , where they want the regulator . 
Sonneneinstrahlungs- Manipulation s like Chemotherapie : 
nobody wants her ! 
but we all want to get another chance for the other side got it to make and the risks to understand ... ... we should be in the situation of a dangerous cancer to suffer . 
- how long does it take up there ? 
- years , a couple of years ... 
- and then what ? 
it' s raining down ? 
- yes , that is correct . 
- don' t schädlichen Nebenwirkungen , of which she know ? 
- what we always ask , that' s Unbekannte of the we don' t know . 
- I understand . 
if they Versauerung to think it' s no problem . 
there' s some Studien , the belegen . 
but the concern of course , there is so little that with research ... ... ... maybe a us - not familiar - Unbekanntes out of the blue , and makes us . 
my name is Mike Murphy . 
I' m Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we treat a subject with the name " Geo- Engineering . " 
we had a fast question the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
I' m afraid I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
we got us ask if they the theories the Klimawissenschaftler support ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere auszubringen ? 
- I should really first Informationsmaterial before I have my opinion ... 
- no problem . you know the subject ? 
- no , not fully ... 
- Überhaupt - no ? 
this is a letter from Wählern , the people are concerned . 
- what are you ... 
- we dokumentieren the Geschehnisse . 
- well , I don' t know . 
you have a Legitimation to be here ? 
- yeah , we got it ! 
we' re also the Security- Check through . - ... ... in through our Creator ... 
- well , I don' t think so . 
- please you don' t touch me ! 
- you ... ... they lie ! - no , do we don' t . 
what should we lied ? 
- no , come on , hurry it up . ... 
- what are we have lied to the court ? 
that was a little strange , right ? 
- I haven' t heard about it , no , no , no . 
- okay 
and it looks like , so if this Programme already go ... 
I got me a proposition t carefully ... ... let me look at that ? 
- I can I want to do . 
do you know ... 
- actually , I have to go ... 
- can we talk to her ? 
- yes ? ... 
no ... 
let me get that . 
I' il me check it out . 
I' il watch me that ... ... and then help act . 
- Herr General ! 
this program . . . . . . Geheim- open this program , Aerosol - Sprühprogramm , " Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering " ( SAG ) ( , SAG= Stratosphärische Aerosol- Sprühungen ] 
- what ? - tons Aluminium in heaven ... sprühen 
- I have no idea what you' re talking about . 
- okay . 
- it' s called " üblicherweise Chemtrails " ... Sir ? 
- come on , hurry it up . 
- you like the Director of NIMA * were , have you seen Aerosol- the flick ? ( Nima = National Imagery and Mapping Agency ) - no . 
Mike Murphy , Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we hear the subject , " " Geo- Engineering ... ... and we wanted to know if your theories the Klimawissenschaftler support ? 
- Congressman ? 
- hello , people . 
we wanted to know if your theories the Klimawissenschaftler support ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere auszubringen ? 
- I' m not familiar with it . 
- I beg your pardon ? 
- I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
- I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
- okay . - put the question in my office ... 
I' m not Anhänger ... 
I didn' t ... it to me very carefully . 
- I didn' t ... 
- did you hear about the subject , because ... ... there will be a public statement now , in the mass media come and Kongress- Kommitees to be in that Programme to discuss . 
I think before we anything in the atmosphere before we should get the effects know , isn' t it ? 
- yeah ! 
- and if we don' t know what it' s effects , we should not going to do it . 
I think we have four ways if we about the choice of Geo- Engineering think about it . 
the first is : 
we verbieten it easy ! 
I' d argumentieren , that you ... ... not on the basis for little Studien to restriktiv to be ... ... that it' d better put the hands of science . 
I think the community scientific Versuche in kleinem Maßstab durchzuführen in this area ... " " ... and it is a question , what exactly scientific this " section " should be ... 
it wasn' t too much Beaufsichtigung and Beschränkung give ... 
Mr. politician ? 
excuse me . 
I' m Mike Murphy of L. A. We at the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
these people run away from this Geo- Engineering thing . 
I wonder why ? 
- I gotta talk to my Mitarbeitern talk about it . 
I don' t know the details . 
- did you have someone on the subject s kind do ? - , sir ? 
Mr. politician , has anyone ever with you on this subject to Engineering Geo- last November ? 
you' re a Befürworter this theories ? 
we would you like to give papers about it . 
- about what ? - Geo- Engineering ? 
you know anything about that Geo- Engineering subject ? 
no . never heard of it . 
this is something about the I never heard of . 
when we today in the sky say we have already seen the run . 
- do you have never heard of Geo- Engineering ? 
- no . 
theories the noisy 10 million tons Metalle in the air to fire . 
Komitee science for this technology , and it' s for the first time , s ... no ? 
- no , never heard of it . 
- well , we were very fond of me . 
- hi , how are you ? 
I' m fine . 
- well , what is it ? 
- we have to the office of Kongressmitglied Watson talking ... ... and their Pressesprecherin , Fr White . . . . . . was familiar with the Gesetzesentwurf " space Preservation Act of Abgeordneten " Dennis Kucinich ... ... the Chemtrails and Militarisierung and galaxy of the atmosphere is mentioned ... ... later , that was some pressure of the Gesetzesentwurf to streichen . . . . . . ... do you have the Aerosol Sprühungen about the Capitol today , see ? 
- politician ? 
- I' il get to them later ... 
Geo- Engineering is there a tremendous Bandbreite to Unsicherheiten , ethische and political Bedenken ... ... and the potential for katastrophale Nebenwirkungen on the Umwelt . 
he' s not the one to interviews s very often , so ... 
- well , needn' t keep you at the breath . 
when Chairman of Komitees for Gerichtsbarkeit ... ... I feel obliged to a public argument about anzustoßen and a report/ ratio about Geo- Engineering anzulegen . 
we' d like to know if you' re a Unterstützer the Maßnamen , 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... 
- no ! - ... ... in the atmosphere to sprühen ? 
- no ! 
I think we need more research . 
okay . 
and aktuellen about the bid ? 
there' s a mountain linear to Beweisen , the - how many people believe - nachweist that this Programme re already in the bid . 
- you know anything about that ? 
- no . 
it' s not safe here to Beweisen mountain . 
but I unterstütze research towards Geo- Engineering and besides , I unterstütze it , a internationale administration whose anzudenken . 
everybody who has examined that , you know ... 
I think that this radikale theories re and I hope we don' t have use ... ... but it might the time , come on that we are forced to say . 
if we could you evidence vorlegen , the belegen that this Programme re already go and JETZT walk ... ... that would you then got no need to get tongue ? 
we had already 3 , 4 Meetings ... Sitzungen to this subject . 
we have a public statement that angesprochen . 
well , not the theories , but the aktuelle to this Programme . 
I unterstütze aktuellen the mission' s not . 
I think we need more research . 
the consequences could have the about a country hinausgehen ... ... and I think we should , too , the question ... s the . 
... is not just a subject of Einsatzes while , but VOR the bid ... ... especially in Hinblick on großangelegte Feldversuche . 
I' il admit that it on this subject generell and I don' t like to see will be world- Reglemente to talk about . 
when these people started , about the Notwendigkeit a Aufsicht through the United Nations Security Council to talk ... ... a über- national Umweltsicherheits- Behörde with a strong Mandat the United Nations ... 
it' s all right , that she after years of world a power to the Manipulation Umwelt re looking for . 
but I think it' il have to be a sort of internationaler contract , all the nation in a common fate lash . 
it' s a common destiny . 
unfortunately , it' s not just the big know this , this could do . 
I know this little . 
or Milliardäre ... ... the possibly say , " I' il save the world , alone , and don' t make me the trouble , this to mention . " 
how we determine , when we have a world- Notsituation ? 
whose is at hand Thermostat ? 
how we determine , when we do with this ? 
aktuell we have no way to do this . 
and what if we start and then a problem with technique or the angle sodaß we have no longer durchführen can ? 
in a or two years come the Aerosole from the atmosphere and then the Temperaturen be much faster than go now . 
it' s these Veränderungsrate , the it' s hard to make us anzupassen . 
so if we even begun to have we will be forced it for long , long time durchzuführen ... ... basically without end in sight . 
Boeing would after streben , this profit to tie , right ? 
I mean , there' s an angle that finanzielle to do ? 
hmm , let' s see ... 
so , don' t let me speak for Boeing . 
- is that don' t mind ? 
- well , it' s what it is . 
but one day , when the United States decide to do this , they' il find a Konzern , that could ... ... and she would there be aufgestellt Boeing the assignment ... ... d rather have instead of him Lockheed Martin drink it . 
of course , we have the industrielle basis for the country , the big help to Technologien and a challenge , beispielsweise Landesverteidigung , I suppose . 
and we' il do the both of Profitgründen than ... the service of the country . 
I think it would be really verheerend , if we in a few years , to ... that there a Geheimprogramm gave , and some government ... ... to answer would have to the Stillen to learn how to bewerkstelligen is . 
it' s pretty clear , that you can the planet cool , but they can and will not the same Klima can return to the she started . 
I suppose they have - or may not - a lot for and Wider with the question how sinnvoll it' s the risks the Klimaveränderung to vermindern . 
I think how did good have a lead , that it could be useful , but we don' t exactly know ... 
but it doesn' t she sure to just demselben Klima back in that she started . 
hierin are s all einig . 
- do you think we have the bid to our in life ? 
- I' m saying : 
I hope not . 
- Al ? 
- I agree . 
I hope not . 
- I sure hope not . 
I can see that as a sort of Rettungsplan ... ... than ... ... you know ... gewissermaßen the brig big Deiche ... ... maybe Emissionsreduktionen to try , s the to stop them auszulöschen . . . . . . . but if they should , she' s coming gewissermaßen do what to do is ... ... in case like a disaster . 
so I see these Optionen more than Katastrophen - Notfallplan and t like the way Verminderung the risks the täglichen Klimaveränderung . 
would you a Verminderung of Fleischkonsums befürworten a chance when you try to reach ? 
- ähh ... ... yes ! 
- how do you suggest we want that umzusetzen ? 
you can' t ... I can' t ... 
it' s your job to decide what besteuert and what will not . 
obviously , if they want that you people behavior change , give them these Anreize or Abschreckungen for your behaviour ... 
- sure that' s the answer , they wanted to hear , Mr. Smith . 
- lf only my time t be past . 
because literally putting on the world Aluminium and Barium Verseuchung will be found ... ... and you believe , it' s coming from this Programmen . 
see you tonight , about the capital , they look like Aerosole ausgebracht will . 
have you seen it ? 
- no , but I can see her . 
the James Bond script is a rich bad planes aufsteigen to the Wolken to impfen . 
how can I help you ? 
- I' m like to talk to you about . 
just call my office on . 
- okay , you know the subject ? 
- how say , Termine about the office . 
- are you a Befürworter this theories ? 
how are you say , pal ? 
- I ... I don' t know anything about this , and I' m late . 
- I have to a hearing . 
- okay , we' il give you a letter about it . 
- that' s a letter to her voters ... 
- I' il take that ! 
- that' s wonderful ! ... ... and a lot of people think this Programme already go , because massive Verseuchungen been found . 
- I don' t know what you mean , " " with this Programme . 
one , two words ... ... to Engineering - Geo- Programme . 
- Geo- Engineering . . . . . . hab´s understood ! 
which plane versprühen . 
so what happened here' s what . 
people in the world find Verseuchungen ... 
- I' il take care of it . 
I speak with them when I get back . 
- thank you . 
we see , even if we' re right about the Durchschnittstemperatur communication , re going to the Niederschlagsmuster today , but re gonna change . 
some places to be a little warmer and some going places . 
well , it' s winner and loser give at this Geo- Engineering activity , if we make it ... ... but nichtsdestotrotz , like David already said : 
there' s reasons why we should consider . 
a lot of people are heavy worried about it , for the Giftigkeit of Aluminium , what do in several Komitees angesprochen already was . 
would you please a look at this letter of some you' re the voters , this Bedenken anspricht . 
- excuse me , I have to go ... 
- okay , can I give you a letter from Wählern . 
you know of the Vorschlägen about that Versprühen ... 
- I' m a little late . 
- I see . 
thank you . 
well , I don' t know about that bescheid , so I don' t know what to do . 
okay . 
so the Geo- Ingenieure hit of Aluminium and Barium in the atmosphere to get ... 
why would you do that ? 
Aluminium s a metal wertvolles we can use . 
well , that would explain target is it , the planet to cool , is there ... 
sounds strange . 
- right , right ! 
so , before they hit this Metalle in the air too little bubbles in principle to the Sonnenstrahlung abzuhalten ... 
we' re here to find out what the Kongressmitglieder ... 
- I hope we have a serious hearing about it , before you decide to do this . 
- I hope it ! ... ... and there' s ausreichende have a lead , not the only andeuten that this Programme already in the bid is , ... ... because we Aluminium - and Barium- Verunreinigungen in the rain , snow and find down . 
- okay , thanks ! 
- thank you . 
L. A. County has a hundred percent - igen Anstieg with Alzheimer- occasions in the past decade verzeichnet . 
many reason - and Wasserproben show high on values Aluminium in the entire Bundesstaat . 
why don' t you give me all the information , they have . 
I have some very good , the workers I' m so beauftragen . 
- and if you to Mr. Lavelle go ... 
- okay ... 
he' s my card . . . . . . send me a Email and we' il ... 
we stay in contact . 
we' re checking the and there' s literally putting a man of Hinweisen , the nahelegen that this Programme . 
schieben give us the mountain over there and we' il that' s see ... 
- lf you in the sky see , you' il win some ... 
- okay ... 
you' il ! 
you can' t quite see how this Aerosole of the aircraft versprüht il ... 
well , thank you very much . 
the future of humanity are a lot of us off . 
we count on people like you ... ... the a few Initiativen sons . 
thank you , thank you , guys ! 
- all right ! 
thank you . 
a lot of Kongressmitglieder s the lead out and runtergelaufen has to doors in the Gängen been looking for the questions auszuweichen ... 
well , obviously is the war against all of us , and we' re all in a Geisellage ... 
people an oath schworen , the Constitution hochzuhalten and defend , don' t know is that this happen , but beteiligen even get it . 
and we all have the duty vorzutreten and our mind to say . 
why is the water verseucht ? 
why is the earth verseucht ? 
why get on with the sickness , Aluminium in context , and all of us betroffen do ? 
and so we' ve all the duty and vorzutreten auszusprechen us to informieren and this here to stop , in our own and the terms of our children . 
this is a entscheidender moment in the history of the world ! 
we men have to determine whether we want to live on our knees ... ... while we every day besprüht and envenomed be ... ... and under ständiger threat or if we live up and live as free people ... ... after the truth , justice , peace and freedom of all streben ... ALLE God' s children . 
as you can see , we finish our movie here in Washington DC . 
we have a lot of Regierungsbeamte on this hingewiesen . 
most have either every Kenntnis abgestritten ... ... or were just not ready with us to talk about the situation . 
now , as you can see , that' s behind the White House ... ... we have the Aerosole . 
that' s Sprühen weitergegangen . 
what' s the answer ? 
the answer is here in Washington , DC ? 
there is no doubt . 
that' s one of the solutions , but the answer is not only here . 
the answer is in DIR ! 
this subject concerning all of us deeply . 
so , look in your Innerstes . 
please , will operational . 
in you . 
catch it at weiterzusagen with steigendem Bewußtsein . 
we believe that over 90 % of the people that are in Unkenntnis ... ... and that means that 90 % of the people who would usually do something ... ... if she' d know , but t do it , because she nichtsahnend are . 
so , look at your heart . 
use your choices , what this is about to the message are . 
the future of humanity depends on !

I' m Ulric , Gesandter Archbishop' s . 
now , what I' m saying , never mind that outside Mauern dringen . 
Bishop s the hand that a village not so s like everybody else . 
it' s the speech about it , it was a Zufluchtsort of the Pest . 
many of the villages re not Pest been destroyed . 
it means that Dorfbewohner entziehen felt the icy air of handle of Death . 
are you sure she is in big Abwegen . 
we' re us in difficult time . 
so , Behauptungen like it so amazing be able to Gebildeten less than two Gehör find us . 
just so we' re Gerüchten and the Aberglauben t aneim . 
God has to be people don' t seem right under control . 
we must see to it that the herd not in Versuchung out of this incident , outside the church and God' s Geboten to Antwon' ten to find . 
I have to see yourself as this village the Pest revenge . 
what have we got to do with it ? 
the village that I' m looking for , s the big one Moor . 
I wanted a leader , a Gottesmann , the me the way weist . 
this is there anybody that would be such a job gewachsen . 
blessings with the Archbishop' s can I borrow any auswählen here . 
but let you out of respect for you choice . 
I can you hinführen .

- it will require any more experience . 
- let' s talk to him .

Osmund , this man is dangerous than the Pest . 
father , I was praying to have a lead . 
God has me geantwon' tet . 
even if you that überlebst , will you change the world out there . 
maybe I' d like to the point , Father .

we have our leader . 
God has no more men left . . . . . . he sent us a boy . 
- think you can handle it , son ? 
- I can you hinführen . 
pray so that you can do it . 
that cut every through the ass to the throat . 
what is that ? 
how much he knows ? 
Ulric knauserig was right about the truth , can you say . 
this village , in that we travel ... ... you have abgeschafft God . 
a Dämon has his place eingenommen . 
it' s called , victims il make people eat , and people are dead back on . 
we get us the leader . . . . . . then follow confession , trial , the execution . 
the Bishop with a Totenbeschwörer even want to go to court . 
what' s a Totenbeschwörer ? 
that' s for the dead , the earth of the cold and get them new life einaucht . 
we have the equipment , we have the sake . 
we go to hell . 
- but God take us . - you got me a mistake . 
come back in your nunnery , if you fooled you feel . 
come on , or and verrichte the work of God . 
let' s the thing clear up soon . . . . . . let us aufbrechen ! 
and you , too , Swire . 
we' re not as bad as you do . 
we' re worse . 
but we need you alive . 
you seem to know how these other s alive . 
I was long in the king' s army , together with Wolfstan and handle . 
I' m telling you the truth . 
we' ve got the Dämon never seen . . . . . . but we have , like it' s coming . 
- what happened to him ? 
- Ivo was captured . 
he talked t , and so have him the French the tongue rausgerissen . 
- and he ? 
- Mold you have to let alone , unless a Blutbad to be done . 
and Dlaywag , that' s a Folterer , it' s a hanging judge . . . . . . he was also a murderer , thief , and Vergewaltiger . 
but this he' s a good man . 
what' s with Ulric ? 
I got a wife and child . 
I' m here because of the money . 
Ulric s here because God has aufgetragen that to him . 
- m burning !

we have to help her .

- what kicks the wife of you ? 
you got our poisoned well , now is our village half- dead . 
I have some water for our blessed one of damage to come on ! 
- I' ve done anything wrong ! 
- liar ! 
that dying and when she was on the well . 
- she has confessed ? 
- we saw how she has gezaubert . 
now , we have to burn her with the rest of the village save ! 
move . 
I beg of you that a second time . 
thank you . 
never hold on . 
come on , you Faulpelz . 
so sure , like sun on - and goes down , re witches burn . 
in a village to the north , there were 128 witches in one night verbrannt . 
that' s 8 hours 16 per hour . 
when the night was over , they had killed everyone women in the village . 
at the end of week vögelten the men pigs . 
the Pest s enough , not yet . . . . . . God brings us to say , pigs to shag . 
have you ever in the village that we' re looking for ? 
no . but I know where it is . 
the hell awaits us both . . . . . . that was told us . 
if you don' t have the guts , then go in , and right away I get your share of the reward . 
what does the church , Pest where this goes ? 
I don' t think so , like so many that God , we punished . 
I say , she comes from France . . . . . . from there is all Übel . 
maybe you' re a minute , Swire come near the truth . 
three Sommern we were fighting with Crecy in the Normandie . 
king Edwards army was zahlenmäßig unterlegen . 
in 20 of us were at least 100 French . 
and the French . oh , this Frenchmen ... 
you like a on the victory . you could smell him . 
but on that took our Schützen this is the first one day , the Langbogen . 
let go to the laden , the Pfeile going on . 
their Pfeile were no use . 
you couldn' t reach us . 
but our were like a dark , summende cloud . 
the night was the field with her dead and dying übersät . 
even in the toughest battle it' s usual , the Misericorde einzusetzen . 
the Misericorde s the " Barmherzigkeitsspender . " 
you trumped through the Achsel right in the heart . 
quick and painless . 
but at that day there was no more ritterliches behaviour . 
king Edward befahl , every French , he was still alive , without Barmherzigkeit kill . 
poor , heads , legs , everything was abgehackt . 
the highest ranks to was a bunch of wild . 
forgive me , but what has that got to do with the Pest ? 
on that day luden we us a to the death . 
he did not leave us ever since then . 
the woman that you were killed , it was not a witch . 
why did you get us volunteer angeschlossen , monk ? 
to God to serve . 
you are witches by God , we kill them . 
the woman was already dead . 
I had , had she out of the mob it again ... and verbrannt . 
I' ve poured the suffering erspart . 
sometimes is that all you can still do . 
he said we should go back . 
that where we wanna go , where are those men to become savage . 
must be something special yes , that you from the cloisters weggelockt did . 
- you want to tell me anything ? - no . 
you know , what is my job ? 
I' m a Folterer , a Wahrheitserzwinger . 
I' m planning to spend hours with a husband .
