WITWATS - German Subtitles version 1 05 ( 2010- 12- 07 09 : 15 : 
could it be that a strange Substanz , found of a man in Südwesten from Arkansas , part of a test the government is ? 
this is the question rund for a phenomenon called " Chemtrails " , this neuerdings big attention erregt . 
they say the government versprüht Chemikalien about us to the weather to controI and to change . 
and they say the ungewöhnlichen Kondensstreifen in heaven , re in a Chemikalien- beladene " Chemtrails . " 
people say , the government versprüht up there Chemikalien to the weather to change and to manipulieren ... ... and leave in there and see what you call this a " Chemtrail . " 
well , if there hinsehe and I think that' s Kondensstreifen , tell me this is " Chemtrails " ? 
yes ! 
a Kondensstreifen have to already aufgelöst . 
that' s interesting , Christina . 
this subject interests so not just in this country , but also in the European countries ... ... actually the whole world . many people are on this subject interests ! 
Dave , you' ve mentioned that Klimaforscher and other the atmosphere were believe ... ... that she sure any sign of this , ominösen Komplotts recognise would . 
our journey started in San Diego , California , where' s tausende scientists , Ingenieure , political Entscheidungsträger and Journalisten ... ... to the " American Association for the Advancement of Science " - conference met . ( AAAS=Amerik . company for wissenschaftl . 
one of the themes was the künstliche Beeinflussung of Erdklimas , even called " Geo- Engineering . " 
during the conference talked scientists about the " Plausibilität " the Durchführung weltweiter Klimaveränderungs- Projekte ... ... under the cloak " Verhinderung the Erderwärmung . " 
a theory that breite Akzeptanz enjoy , beats in " ETWAS " in the atmosphere to sprühen . 
when scientists to already laufenden Aerosol - Sprühprogrammen asked were , erklärten her ausdrücklich , that no derartigen Programme ever umgesetzt were . 
but oddly enough entsprachen those theories the same ... ... what people rund around the world now say that already happened . 
when I heard that the " American Association for the Advancement of Science " - conference here abgehalten will ... ... and s a large portion of the themes to Engineering Geo- ... I just had to come . 
I had to be onboard . 
I had to hear what this big Klimaveränderungs- scientists have to say . 
... ... to the other question to " Chemtrails " and Wettermanipulationen ... ... already now eingesetzt without our knowledge . 
I' m here a personal see them , except that I even in Regierungsämtern ve worked ... ... in a high Ebenen at the White House and the Landesregierung . 
personally , I' d be there sooner skeptisch ... ... but to be honest with you . 
" you can' t know what you don' t know . " 
Chemtrails ! 
in the Internet they' re as proof of what she said angegeben that the government künstliche Wolken erzeugt to the Erderwärmung entgegenzuwirken . 
you claim that the American government with more Duldung the national government ... ... in Geheimen planes verwendet to Ballungszentren with ... ... Aluminium , Barium and Strontium to besprühen ... ... to the Bedürfnislosigkeit ( ! ) the people and as the Weltbevölkerung to your airspeed as indicated . 
I' m always a little skeptisch , because me the government say ... ... not capable of Appears , soetwas in a so big Umfang to make . 
that' s not rain , this is no time . 
believe Sie´s or not . 
Militärflugzeuge versprühen in this Region , " Chaff " ! ( dt . " Düppel " = Radartäuschkörper ] 
little Aluminiumteilchen , sometimes they are of the plastic or even metallbeschichtete Papierstücke ! 
you are to Radar- resist and obviously trainieren the that . 
so , they wouldn' t you admit , but I was many years Marinesoldat ... ... and tell them that easy . 
what goes on here . 
Militärflugzeuge , some come from the Key West Airforce base ... ... get in the atmosphere up and re Polyester- stripes up , some are a little breiter ... ... other once house from Fiberglas , ummantelt with Aluminium . 
the Air Force kicks these things from her aircraft ... ... the then drop down , what sometimes a all day before . 
this is unweigerlich military or ... ... here' s what off ... ... the government the Air Force ... 
if they such paragon see ... ... you can be sure . 
there' s something up . 
that is so little , fine , magnetische ... tiny- little stripes ... ... either from Aluminium ... 
it' s a offence find out what' s real and don' t . 
but it looks like , so if this a lebensrettende Massnahme of Militärs is . 
the augenscheinliche motive behind this " Verschwörungstheorie " is : 
a Weltregierung ( Stimmengewirr : quiet in the hall ! 
order in the hall ! 
I can' t hear nothing . 
Mr Chairman ! 
I want this house versichern that both my Ministerium than my Amtskollege the Gesundheitsminister ... ... an hour for correspondence to this subject will have the different that this Verschwörungstheorie t ... ... a Körnchen truth contains and the beobachteten stripes the planes ... ... just from the Triebwerken stammen . 
order ! ... ... and I think that this a anschauliches example for the new Sprecherin the Labour party ... ... that she Verschwörungstheorien about the U. S. government is out . 
- order ! 
it' s called " Geo- Engineering . " 
the Erderwärmung fight , by killing chemischen dust in the atmosphere get and so schädliche Strahlung in the space reflektiert . 
our Definition of " Geo- Engineering " is : 
bewusste , großflächige procedures in the ( Klima - : system the earth . 
a Bandbreite of plans to Klimaveränderung was diskutiert . 
a klassisches instance s the Einbringung of reflektierenden particles in the Erdumlaufbahn . 
on the other hand , could give it some good reasons about Aluminium think sometimes . 
it' s it out that it a lot of work over the Umweltverträglichkeit of Aluminium in the Stratosphäre . 
the big thing is that Aluminium a 4- even bigger Volumenstrom in little Partikeln has than sulfur . . . . . . . and that is that we have a 4- d surface for the same Strahlungsantrieb . 
we have a about 16- fach kleineren Koagulationsfaktor ... ( Partikelverlust through Zusammenschluß too great P. / time : ... and that bewirkt really a Verminderung . 
it looks like we with a geringeren Mengen auskommen . 
and that' s the reason in the Hughes Aircraft Patenten out of the year 1989 ... ... of Aluminium the speech . 
and that' s why we find Aluminium in Wasserproben , the to the surface on were . 
and here we have David Keith ... ... who says Aluminium has a 4- even bigger Strahlungsantrieb . 
so , they want that we think it' s about sulfur , but ... ... they have to verplappert and rausgelassen ... ... that Aluminium four times a better s for their targets to reach ... ... and it looks like as were they don' t that we the effects whose know . 
that little picture this is about a study about Nanopartikel - Fertigung the show , that you qualitativ very hochwertige ... ... what a plane very simple is ... ... qualitativ hochwertige Aluminiumpartikel make some , just by killing Aluminiumdampf sprüht , the oxidiert . 
so it' s backing possible and there' s already a breite Literatur , the to get busy . 
and you can do that , by killing either new planes is or the bestehenden umrüstet ... 
well , there' s a couple of ideas ... 
ask at a Technologie- company on , if you umsetzen can ... ... and she will not tell you that the very complicated . 
they' il tell you : yes , we can do that ! 
it looks like Klimaveränderung through Aerosole ( Sprühpartikel ) sound so cheap ... ... that expenses don' t even have a subject il be . 
this is the Umsetzung are a lot of a Risiko- risk call off . 
that' s a chance to do it to the risk t it to do . 
and it' s the problem , how we verwalten , grundlegend harder and different than else . 
well , I' m telling you , it' s cheap Stoffe in the Stratosphäre to get and I' m convinced that that' s right . 
I don' t think that that s going to change . 
but I think the more we weiterforschen the less just is the thing look ... ... the complicated re the effects of the Umwelt look . 
that' s it ! 
because right now , it looks to just out ! 
so , I think if we more forschen to find out that this is probably harder and komplizierter s than we thought ... ... and that the Nebenwirkungen difficult to managen are . 
and that' s a healthy result that Management easier will do . 
of course , is the gegenteilige reaction possible . 
it' s a empirische ( =erfahrungsbasierte ) question , like people really think that this is what will if she plans know . 
a different reaction would be example : 
if this , scientists so worried about it is , CO² in the atmosphere to little bubbles ... ... and that would really mean that we us in with the risk of CO² in the atmosphere auseinandersetzen should . 
and by the way , it' s not really a moral danger . 
it' s more like Trittbrettfahren on expenses of our times a grandma . 
aktuelle Studien about the Luftqualität , u. a. from California Air Quality Resource Board ... ... find out of that stayed in little Partikel especially For for the Atemwege be . 
during the whole argument today , I have no Erwähnung about this Fall- out is ... ... is that ... ... and have been on the one so hochreaktiven Metalls like Aluminium to Vergiftung of ground and Grundwasser . 
the question is , what the effects of Materialien on the human bless you were when they from the Stratosphäre herunterkommen ... ... in the special little Aluminiumpartikel . 
my elements of the Aerosol- study , people from the Carnegie Mellon university , have the effects of the human health ... ... ... and though we don' t have veröffentlich was this the first what we' ve been ... ... to the Größenordnungen to berechnen , not with pencil and paper ... ... but with a an expert for Gesundheitsauswirkungen on people , if this could be a subject . 
so , to Aluminium or else Partikel , there' s a lot of toxologischer aspects , of course , the to be just a look at it must . 
but naturally , considering the enormen number of Partikeln and the Gesundheitsauswirkungen this little particles , s the answer ... ... what we know t been released yet , but the first was , what have we here ? - some führende an expert ... ... the epidemiologische in to do research on health , say that t even in the Ansatz a subject is . 
let me again s : 10 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere versprüht , don' t have effects of the human health ? 
let me here be careful . 
we separate the question of Giftigkeit ... ... so , we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and t been released yet . 
so , we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and t been released yet . 
we have begun to examine your first Aluminium and t been released yet . 
Dane saw in on and said , 
so , you tell me that the Versprühen of 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... ... no effects of the human bless you have ? 
he holte deep air , schluckte , and he said : 
let me here be careful . 
we don' t have serious Studien to Aluminium done , so it could be that we in a dreadful thing to what we don' t bethought . 
and that was for me the just so what about the public gelangen will be : 
it' s the schädigenden Aluminium physics of the in the world be step on the panel . 
and here' s David Keith with right this subject konfrontiert and there is he , so if she now the cat from the bag have left ! 
we don' t have serious Studien to Aluminium done , so it could be that we in a dreadful thing to what we don' t bethought . 
so they' re on , because the evidence and the Agenda separated re from the try this Klimaerwärmung to prevent . 
obviously there are even some other targets . 
if Bevölkerungsreduktion , control , Waffen- aspects , of course , Telekommunikation ... 
all möglichen things about the genaues we don' t know . 
we know it' s not really , and I don' t even mutmaßen , what exactly the targets re ... ... but one we can see all right . 
these things are not ... These things are not vorteilhaft for humanity . 
it supporting the intention of Elite . 
so , I think the question is where we the Trennlinie re between ... ... Aktivitäten , the don' t mind re and don' t need globale ... and Aktivitäten , the on a globale ... benötigen . 
Dr. Holdren he' s ready to explain the president' s in terms science and technology and ... ... than director of the offices for science and technique - strategy ( OSTP ) available to stand . 
I look forward to his weisen Beirat in the coming years . 
my personal opinion is , we have to Engineering Geo- on the table now . 
we have to look at this very carefully , because we could desperate enough il be einzusetzen about it . 
what would I do , if we in the year 2040 or 2060 , a dramatic Klimakrise have ? 
with , let' s say , weitreichenden Hungersnöten or Grünland that suddenly in the sea versinkt ... ... and the only annehmbare way we start could , the earth abzukühlen ... ... would be a direct surgery in the Klimasystem , beispielsweise by we Partikel in the Stratosphäre einbringen . 
of course , do we always have any things in the Stratosphäre . well , it' s not like that the Stratosphäre absolutely untouched would be . 
but we don' t want that any people off and things to do the a big Strahlungsantrieb have ... ... or about a longer Zeitraum big Mengen to reaktionsfreudigem material einbringen ... ... what a erheblichen of damage on the Ozonschicht to follow could have . 
you know , maybe I' il bring Partikel in the atmosphere a because I' m trying to to make some money . or I' il take Partikel in the atmosphere a to scientific research to an and trying to the Wolken- physics to understand ... I' il take Partikel in the atmosphere a because I' m trying it in definite Regionen rain to leave ... ... and the Wolken to impfen and so more time to our Schipisten to do . 
and this kicks , of course , many questions on . it' s üblicherweise risikoreich . 
it' s probably on some people have a negativen Effekt ... ... but we could us in a situation find them in the it pays off these risks to us to take . 
one of the things that really have me all in shock was the match the Vorteile and risks this Programme . 
so , the Vorteile : 
an element was that Abkühlen of the planet . 
some of the called risks were Ozonloch , droughts in Africa and Asia . 
I can you say : 
after I four days that scientists have been listening . . . . . . for four days Symposium ... ... I' m really worried because now sure is that she rechtfertigen , rationalisieren and try ... ... a few really , really terrible effects , more Auswirklungen to our Umwelt to rechtfertigen . 
and basically formulieren the Verkaufsstrategie , the Umsetzungs and administration ... ... and the Finanzierungsstrategie . 
go to San Diego , I was like all in shock of this Programmen that I mean have to write me about it . 
after the Fertigstellung of Artikels in the night , sendete I this one Internet- magazine , with my Emailadresse angefügt . 
the next morning was my Email- Posteingang überschwemmt with Rückmeldungen of the world . 
why ? 
because I Aluminium in context with Geo- Engineering- Modellen mentioned have ... and then didn' t know that so many people about it on are . 
well , it' s but so , that metal - Aluminium - in big Mengen , far beyond more normal values , everywhere in the rain , ground and snow be found . 
in the follow strömten calls of people in the desperate someone didn' of this recherchiert . 
that was the tip- off of for that movie . 
before we started to filmen , we had the opportunity with one of our geschätztesten Autoren and Dokumentarier , G Edward Griffin ... ... to meet to find out what he knew about the subject . 
I want a minute about a subject see , this always more attention on the draw . 
this subject , that' s exactly scientific " Stratospherisches Aerosol Geo- Engineering " mean , " Chemtrail called " - phenomenon . 
it' s these Kontroverse Chemtrail against Contrail ( Kondensstreifen ) very well wisdom . 
now I feel so befasst have , that' s a klarer case . 
I have the Entwicklungen of Flugzeug- Verkehrs since his frühesten days s watching . 
I wohnte in the corner of Flughafens in Los Angeles . 
I can me in the first Jets remember the there rape . 
boy , what the for a noise did ! 
so , we had a noise I never seen it happen . 
we were often the end of Landebahn and saw this Jets to like her rape and abhoben ... ... because the for us a new experience was . 
I was planes my whole life watching and I know what Kondensstreifen are . 
I' ve been watching her . 
you house from verdampfter Feuchtigkeit , Eiskristalle , the in the atmosphere sucks will ... ... and then shine soon , verdampfen and get out of here , as you can see . 
a plane is over , followed by a little white line right behind it ... ... and it about 10 or 20 Flugzeuglängen to it than that he' s gone ! 
by the way you can do this , today from time to time watching : 
" there' s a Kondensstreifen ! " 
these other things , talk about the we here , re not the same at aIl phenomenon . 
those planes flying over and little bubbles this white smoke out ... ... the all the sky of Horizont until Horizont covers and s not at all auflöst ! 
the question is : 
why ? 
I have my own Vermutungen , but I hope that a couple of good investigative Journalisten out of there go and get us the answer . 
I know , if always the thing herauskommt - and she becomes - the people do that re bound to say : 
" yeah , well ... we have it for EUCH done , guys . " 
" it' s for the good of the Allgemeinheit ! " 
" it' s for the company . " free to the Klimaerwärmung to prevent . 
or maybe at the people against an attack with irgendeiner terrible Biowaffe to impfen . 
" we can' t rumlaufen and every one injection in the arm in , but we besprühen and so they can save your life . 
you see , how good we' re ! 
" we do it for the good of the society . " 
I know , whatever it is , they' il say it' s for your own good ... ... and mine . 
get out before . 
if we had the chance to that a Hurrican and a s in , New Orleans , Louisiana to meet . 
and we on , we could take him like that , that he instead , Mississippi scores ... ... where instead of a hundred ... ... so ... I' d , more or less 18 from Mississippi to kill 1, 800 of New Orleans to save . 
and if you do that , aim you got there , would you then this 100 men murder ? 
here , there' s a whole lot of Rechtsfragen . 
it looks like , so if that Sprühen mostly in NATO countries s appearing . 
I have seen it here in the United States , I got it in England , I have seen it to Scotland seen ... 
I have seen it here in Canada , and I have reports of people from France . 
there are a Gruppierung . 
any political Gruppierung - of globalem amount . 
it' s not just an American phenomenon . 
it' s international and I think that any of this d like to examine your this fact berücksichtigen should . 
you' re a political Gruppierung and a POLITISCHES motive find ! 
but my bescheidene mind hierzu : 
it' s no way to your or my health . 
I don' t know what it is , but we' il be there soon find out ! 
I' m sure if you the old Ratschlag " follow the money " folgst ... ... you will sooner or later find the answer . 
we have fast notice that we had the same need this information to issue . 
the public teilhaben let people know now what it' s done . 
Edward was from this thing that touch that he suggested has to help us . 
so , the just so after that Budget everything seems ... ... it' s the deal now fertigzukriegen . 
and we don' t do this without any answers to . 
we' re not scientists . 
we ask genaugenommen just questions . 
and we' re very skeptisch with the answers . 
that' s it on the point , Margie . 
why SEHEN people t you ? 
you listen , it' s not . 
you know , it' s not . 
you' il get the facts not on the table . 
you know , we got big luck ! 
look , which way us here in my lap like it is . 
( laughs ) ... way ! 
- yes , actually ... 
- yeah ! 
- it' il be a fight will . 
- a Herausforderung and a fight . but why are we here ? 
- you' re now on ... 
- all right ! 
I saw the sky with a Zick- Zack- paragon of Chemtrails ! 
I don' t know any more if in L. A. or on the street , but I saw in heaven ... ... and thought . 
look at the on ! 
you are never that Flugrouten ! 
that was a Gitter ! 
a Gitter ! 
a regelrechtes Gitter over the city and I traute my eyes . 
- milchig , white Wolken ! 
now s all very einleuchtend out . 
we have proof the Bodenproben with the Aluminium , Barium , Strontium ... ... and what we in the Patenten get and what the Klima- Ingenieure tell me what' s going to happen . 
for the Normalbürger is that a Volltreffer ! 
this is a heikler wait for the herrschenden Mächte . 
because she a verdeckte operation like the " Troposphärische Aerosol program , " or " Chemtrails " ... ... project " Ikarus " or whatever . 
it was a name in the of the years . 
and she rather it around in a public , science Klimaveränderungs- Sonnen- shield , because the Klimaerwärmung from the oar goes . 
so , right now is the belly of the beast right about us without schützende armour . 
I don' t care if the people of Chemtrails believe it or not , the Klimamanipulations- thing was frightful be enough . 
and if people about Geo- Engineering all know , re Chemtrails obviously , DASSELBE ... ... because it is ! 
so , we' re talking about a WELTWEITE plot ? 
Klima- scientists have suggested the world to make . 
we' re on our way to Redding , California . 
that' s the second step to the AAAS- conference . 
we' il see what I can find . 
we' re here in northern California at the house of Dane Wigington . 
he has about 2, 000 morning country ( about 8 km² ) with a look at Lake Shasta . 
he' s told me about the a challenge the them up here . 
let' s talk with Dane . 
we' il see what goes on his Grundstück . 
we' il see what he so durchmacht and what Maßnahmen he shoots , he scores , and the Testergebnisse the he did . 
well , I' m from the Energiewirtschaft . 
I' m in the first Sonnenkraftwerken of the country , in the frühern ' 80s , working . 
my house was on the cover of the world biggest Magazins for erneuerbare Energien . 
so , this is my Background . 
my target is it , the public to alarmieren . 
a man of giftigem material s herab on us point . 
about five years ago our skies üblicherweise blue and now he' s full of Striche and Schleier ... ... and practically NICHTS what you here at the Horizont and buried see is a natural cloud ! 
it' s actually all Rückstände this Flugzeug- lines with the to ausbreiten in Wolken , künstliche Wolken ... 
the sky looks like a dirty out ! 
no more white Wolken and blauer heaven , how have a few years ago . 
there they look like with huge Industrieaktivität or at Waldbränden . 
we' il see that typischerweise every night . 
even in Bodennähe s the clarity clear reduced ... ... we don' t that , except at the days of which we these long , anhaltenden stripes do ... ... the to ausdehnen and all the sky bedecken . 
in some days , you can even see how these lines with vertical abfallen , like a Schleier . 
we assume that , the particles absenken . . . . . . and we have the tests , the to prove that we with Mengen to Aluminiumpartikel überschwemmt il ... ... the literally putting zehntausende times are higher than the ohnedies up angesetzten Grenzwerte . 
so , we see this is not about a geringe prozentuelle Erhöhung this giftigen substances . 
we talking about Mengen ... beispielsweise of the side of that mountain Mt . 
Shasta ... 
when you get there hinüberschwenken ... that' s a Wahrzeichen northern Kaliforniens , that as unberührtes Wasserreservoir know . 
Aluminium - our Schneeprobe of a Hang of Mt . Shasta was 61. 000 ppb . 
( parts which Billon=Teile a Milliarde=10- ³ ppm : . 
that' s gewöhnliches Schneewasser . 
and the people drink this stuff , if they the mountain besteigen . 
and remember : 
Amtshandlung is necessary on 1, 000 ppb . 
that' s 61- fach about the gesetzlichen Grenzwert and our climber drink this giftige water ... ... on Mount Shasta . 
Barium : 
eight- three , Strontium : 
383 
so in this summer , the people who bergsteigen , drink giftiges water . 
basically , taken away ! 
I don' t want to be 61. 000 Mikrogramm a quart Aluminium drink . 
and again , we have already the pH- values in this country to the 10 to 12- fache up and can see that clearly show . 
it' s not suspicions . 
we can clearly show that this Metalle in the rain were . 
we have mehrfache samples . 
Bakkalaureus the Naturwissenschaften , Internationale school for Forstwirtschaft in Missoula ... ... master in Zoologie , Spezialisierung on Wasserfauna ... ... thirty five years as Wildtier- Biologe for the US Forstverwaltung ... ... and before a couple of years Bodenschutz for the USDA Bodenschutz service . 
besides , I ran Botanik- Programme , grass - and Weideland- Programme ... ... and m running this still . 
the moment I do a lot of Beratungstätigkeit for Meistergärtner . 
when I this garden ... in the year G begun have ... ... was that , pH balance this between 5, 5 and 5, 6 . 
this is the old Bodengutachten . 
you can here , on this side ... ... my floor see . 
here with investigation 125 , 126 ... this is my house . 
and here , the Bodenreaktion ... pH should between 4 . 5 and 6, 0 are . 
and over here in the mud it' s even a little tan . 
here he is just 6, 8 . 
and what' s this with the shoots in Ökosystemen ? 
well , we' il make one of the things from and watch those little ... ... things to the in the floor herumkrabbeln . often find they not even more ! 
those little Gliederfüßer you hardly under the Mikroskop can see ... 
with the here , you can see the Bewegungen ... ... the little wee , mikroskopischen ... ... looks like a little bewegende particles . 
this start to get out ! 
you are not a go , but they start to get out . 
this is Eicheln the Färbereiche ... 
this is Zedernholz ... 
come on , guys ! 
this should be pH- mad and the Messung makes a worth 10 fach higher than expect ? 
something right here by terrific t ! 
- look , you this whole reports . 
a whole lot . 
- this 20 reports . 
two twenty . 
I' d say more to the 30 ... 
all show dangerous Mengen Aluminium ... ... and Barium ! 
the science says there' s something komisches ... ... and the whole Schwarzmaler say : 
" so ? s a neutraler , pH balance not good ? " 
- no ! 
neutral s not good . 
neutral s not good . if your ground , pH balance of 5, a six , and he should have to stay there , if you want a healthy anti- forest . . . . . . and if you a healthy anti- garden want , you should your , pH balance between 6, 0 and 6, 5 beibehalten . 
I think it' s necessary that we wake up and see what' s happening here ... ... because we can' t just ignore because it always worse and worsens ... ... if we' II ignore it on and verdrängen and just say : 
we had Einweckgläser , all the new , sterilisiert , in which we the rain gesammelt . 
and we had a HEPA filter ( Schwebstofffilter ) with the we the air getestet . 
okay , so you have rain gesammelt and the air gefiltert . 
what did you find ? 
Aluminium and Barium . 
this is still a test the 375 000 ppb , Bryan . 
Barium at three . 090 , Strontium with 345 . 
yes . this is about a doppelwandigen pond . 
with EPDM- Dichtungsbahnen for Fischzucht . 
( EPDM = Ethylen- Propylen- Dien- Monomer- Kautschuk : there' s no Chemikalien or sonstige Stoffe in this Dichtungsbahnen , the in the water gelangen could . 
this poetry was developed for this use . 
the well , that was the pond speist getestet and again getestet . 
no Aluminium nachweisbar ! zero ! 
the only other source that pond speisen can s Regenwasser . 
we' re here on a gefilterten Waldanhöhe . 
meilenweit away from jeglicher industry , interstate or like that . 
for a few days , with heftiger Sprühaktivität , we could see that s a movie on the Wasseroberfläche bildete . 
we' ve got this shift getestet and the result : Aluminium and Barium ! 
after one and one- half years Ansammlung we had 375 000 ppb Aluminium in it . 
that' s literally putting giftig ! 
we can clearly in that what we in the sky see the same like , what in diversen Patenten beschieben is ... ... and the Stoffe in Erdreich stimmen with which the Patente agree . 
this Stoffe were 5 years not here ! 
in this Mengen is that a neuartiges phenomenon . 
in some occasions a Anstieg of 50, 000 percent , in case of Aluminium . 
from of the primordial Messung of 7 ppb what ohnedies on up was up for 50, 000 % in five years . 
we have tiefgreifende changes in this time seen . 
Dr. Lennard Thyme , doctor in really . I' ve done with him a Gegenprobe and he says that the Oxide of Aluminium , Barium and Strontium that , pH balance ... ... from a sauren floor to a neutralen change . there is no question . 
- and that' s just ... - that' s exactly what you can keep an eye on ! 
- oh ... 
I' ve got a Doktortitel in anorganischer really of the Oregon State University ... ... and ve worked with various Metallen and Oxidationszuständen . 
then I have a postal Doktorat at the Brandeis university done ... ... with the I on the Stabilisierung the Oxidation assorted Metalle ve worked . 
the target is find out what it all this dynamische the balance of life fügt . 
I have to Francis up on Mount Shasta worked and he told me some Regenwasser- analysis ... ... however , the way ... ... with Aluminium - , Barium - and Strontium- Werten in the atmosphere to do . 
so , I think the wesentliche Giftstoff in this Chemtrails is that Aluminium . 
the values , the we of Mount Shasta can keep an eye on , re completely unacceptable ! 
if we of Metallen in germ Systemen see , we don' t talk about Aluminium Massenware of the people think ... ... if they Dosenlimonaden and like that ? 
if it once in the Aluminiumoxid- condition übergegangen is s out front now it' s a shift in the Blutgefäßen and SCHALTET the LEBEN AB ! 
if elements , the not generally in the Umwelt are , for once in the neighbourhood eingebracht be bell a few proper Alarmglocken . 
Aluminium s most awkward in germ Systemen . 
it' s hard , lets don' t let go and nullifies the system on - and war´s then ! 
by killing in the as time Aluminium ansammelt , causes it that' s quite neurologische damage ... ... because it' s as Aluminiumoxid there ablagert , that in principle there in stay and of normal system can' t be dropped Over . 
the Gesundheitszustand of every people s always a man named Maß with Giftstoffen to do ... ... and Aluminium is known for krebserregende physics to do . 
the Halbwertszeit beträgt Jahrzehnte ! 
I think we should work out of this Giftstoffe our Umwelt to okay , instead of more Gifte einzubringen . 
it' s very bedenklich that if we more Gifte zuführen , we the payments and the risks of cancer , higher . 
it' s so sad that people think about it , Aluminium in the Umwelt einzubringen about something to bewerkstelligen and in danger go bigger and anzurichten . 
wherever this Stoffe , come here , they' re here ! 
the on us herabregnenden Metalle don' t get bestreiten . 
that' s absolutely no Spekulation ! 
how already told have to the Metallmengen in the last four years after the Tausendfache increases ... ... and the line for Luftqualität in California has the of China herüberkommenden Aerosole here . 
Mike , the reason why I mean have primär this subject anzusprechen ... ... is the because I everybody else themes for zweitrangig hold . 
what could Dringlichkeit have a higher than not before the door re going to do ... ... and a Atemzug to get no air in Schwermetalle aufzusaugen ? 
if our Böden poisoned will if our Gewässer poisoned il ... ... what remains us , then left ? 
for what we do always our time and energy aufwenden ... ... whatever our political shot , this is a salvage basis for all of us . 
we need air the Atmen , the t full of giftiger Chemikalien and Metalle is . 
we need water t that a verseucht s about whatever those planes ablassen . 
people stopped trying to consider that our atmosphere so thin s like a Farbschicht on a basketball . 
it' s an extremely thin shift , the life on this planet possible . 
you just as Physiklabor to mißbrauchen and that to experiment until she beyond any saving ... ... is a stupidity of unglaublichem amount . 
if people would understand that this sort of forced ... ... not just JETZT happen , but been geraumer time go . for 50 years it' s a lot of Klima - and weather - Veränderungs- Programme given up the Kenntnis of Großteils public a entziehen . 
and if they think that you don' t vote ... ... that she had kind of notice that soetwas s going ... ... I would ask them things like " Agent Orange " ( Entlaubungsmittel in the Vietnam War ) anzusehen and other things make the know this because they have the power to that . 
because nobody there is that she is . 
because she these huge Militärmaschinerien have the all controI want and maybe ... ... they have yes that document the government seen ... ... verfügbar for jenen , the in the Internet online s whose name is " Owning the weather " ! ( the property of the Wetters ] 
a erklärtes target our government . 
and not only our government . 
he' s got the Press Associated mitgeteilt that the American government " techniques to Wetterveränderung " that was ... ... that it for the " new Weltordnung " possible , million Americans cold to leave and the rest to controI . 
to this Wettermanipulations- Methoden ... ... the entire Patente to gear 
Senator Clayborne Pell´s vollständige statement and his own Erzählung , not only that this exist ... ... but we have it verwendet zurückreichend to the Vietnam War . 
- we shall do all we can . 
- how are we , what we' re gonna do . 
you got the scientists behind you . 
scientists re with you , at least DIESER scientists s the matter with you ! 
- I don' t have a Millionen- Budget , but I' ve had enough to show that here something terrible goes wrong . 
- all right ! 
Arizona , then next Monday , the 21 . 
Senator Johnson to show Low . we' re so long with the car to be on my way . 
- it' s a pleasure to meet you . 
- we love it here . 
it' s so abgeschieden , so calm and out peaceful . 
my name is Karen Johnson . 
I was 12 years in Parlament of Bundesstaates Arizona . 
I was 8 years in Repräsentantenhaus ... ... and four years in Senat . 
if a plane überfliegt ... ... and the flick from the plane ... ... from a end of the Horizonts the other s enough ... ... and starts to auszudehnen and wellenförmig more and more of the heavens to bedecken ... ... and to ausbreitet see it all the sky covered ! 
how can only someone think that would be normal as that ? 
and then beneath to live and to know that the - whatever it is - on a herabrieselt ... ... and in the animals and on the ground ... ... so ... 
that' s frightful . 
and if people t really wake up soon , and the fact in the eye re Iooking ... ... that we men have the terrible things to do with us ... ... and we' d better wake up soon , and we fight back , JETZT ! 
you know , I have 11 children . 
I' ve got five times a grandma . 
I have much to lose here ! 
I care , what for my children to stay il ! 
it' s just me and I' m very fond of me , what is left for her stay . 
Aluminium s giftig . 
besides , we do know that it is anhäuft . 
we know that we always more of this index . 
we' il take it about the air on , let' s drink it with our water ... ... and we can always more Mengen on . 
so , the idea that ... ... more Aluminium in our neighbourhood freigesetzt s in the way it to describe how you have s very frightful ... ... and very verstörend for us . 
those who issued of us , the Untersuchungen about you , are very worried about that the Allgemeinheit bad information is ... ... and at all about that it' s done . 
Aluminium s giftig ! 
we know that . 
you can gonna discuss it , what Giftmengen for the body schädigend re ... ... but anbetracht the fact that it' s anhäuft ... ... is this erschwerend . 
the t worry about everything going on in there is beyond the Meßgrenze ! 
why it' il be don' t mind that we always besprüht be in the entire United States - in the whole WELT ? 
who pays for that ? 
so , the cases Alzheimer up like a Mondrakete ... ... what obviously with the Anhäufung of Aluminium in the Gehirnzellen to do . 
I think , in every family is a member to find that under Alzheimer s . 
and it' s a horrible ... ... a terrible affliction . 
and to say : 
" it' s just because the people Limonaden from tins of drink . " 
you know my father died with Alzheimer and he has never been drinking . Dosenlimonade this explanation doesn' t sound very einleuchtend for me . 
and so I ask me : 
how much did this Chemtrail- Sprühen , back in the neighbourhood of Illinois him geschädigt ? 
a friend of us for 20 or 30 years in Arizona , Feuerwehrmann Pine ... ... and he says that this Waldbrände , they today , a fight heftiger are than , everything they have seen the opener . 
and if anyone the Luftmessungen and this little easy flammable Aluminiumpartikel looks at ... ... and the Magnesium on the trees ... ... that causes never dagewesene Waldbrände . 
here you can see . 
that' s split a million . 
you gave me this zugeschickt and I' m awfully find it interesting because we just about two parts a million in our air have to . 
and it says here that we have 39 000 parts Aluminium . 
that' s a astronomischer worth ! 
the Barium- value is up ! 
well , that' s beyond of good and bad ... ... what people breathe better or for her herabregnet . 
and the people wonder is that your health adrift , and she' s in the Notaufnahmen have to . 
why did she Atembeschwerden ? 
why get them Alzheimer ? 
it was planned ! 
we have such Eliten ... 
I don' t know how you want to call her . 
" one- Worlders , " " Illuminati " what I know ... 
, as usual , you want to call her . 
these people with t worry about the Durchschnittsbürger ! 
you see just about yourself , your greed , your power ... ... and if so 2/ 3 or 4/ five of us from this planet eliminieren ... ... s fine for these people ! 
because , then they have to t get more that' s why I soviele people herumzutreiben and to see . 
well , it' s a lot of the worum´s this is ! 
and it' s very , very alarmierend and frightful . 
so where' s that stuff from ? ... and WARUM ? 
why is such a stuff out there pass out ? 
so , I have so many explain is : 
" yes we have to the planet cool ... " and this and this ... ... but when people try the planet to cool , why do you need then such things in it ? 
the explain have never very authentic for me geklungen . 
when I my Equipment aufstellte , she saw me in and he said : 
" all the trees going to die ! " ... and I said : 
please ? 
you said : 
" all the trees going to die ! " 
so , I thought all right , teste I on Aluminium , because that' s one of the Hauptsachen in this Programmen s about the we here to talk ... ... and Titan ... ... so , I took a sample of of a bark and ran a program test on it . the result was positive with Aluminium and Titan . 
and then I started in California herumzureisen , bemerkte I on all the same . 
in Lake Tahoe were too many Rinden the same way to find in the whole region from Sacramento , and Davis ... ... everywhere where I went , bemerkte I this silber- white bark . 
I think this Chemikalien dringen in the floor a and destroy the roots ... ... and then if they aufsteigen , gelangen them in the bark of Baumes . 
these two over here , re just now . 
I' m so hurt , watching like this ... ... look how old and big they are . 
we' ve probably 40 trees lost in our 10 morning country . 
every week , every second weekend see a more tree , the starts to die . 
it' s just so sad . 
we cry just ! 
and used to think about the something to do with it could have , together with the other explain ... ... would I really dreadful frustrieren ! 
if you always a tree down ... 
this is just not right . 
it' s just terrible ! 
and here' s another one over there in this little Baumgruppe . 
feels it' s no better on in waking up and to fight , instead of into a little leak to crawl and sleep to go ? 
so ... UM GOTTES WILLEN , LEUTE ! 
your families s out there , your kids out there ... ... and your times a grandma ! 
I mean ... 
you MÜSST ETWAS TUN UM ZU HELFEN ! 
my greatest hope is to get people to Hinterfragen . . . . . . and if they not wake up , while where we are , I hope a few seed pflanzen to do . 
we' re the most place of the planet . 
Hawaii ... ... at the store the things to see and data to provide . 
thank you , that plane before are you with us . 
however , we hope that you could get a chance to enjoy the trip . 
we wish you a great vacation or " welcome home , " if you so happy , here to live . 
the whole of the valley s autark . 
we have either Sonnen - , or Windenergie or Generatoren . 
- look at that ! 
- yeah , like a dream , you can' t get even ausdenken . 
- that' s right . 
even if you come from becomes here , this paradise here just now be destroyed . 
you make it to the " Insel- method . " 
you take it outside the sea , removed from the island . 
and so you see the Chemtrail- planes t . 
the theory that she is out on the sea , and ... 
- ... and so it comes in to us ! - ... and it KOMMT HEREIN ! 
these here come from west . 
and she sprühen this also of both sides at once . 
a lot of the stuff this is really of the Chemtrails out of this way . 
this Stoffe here ... ... they' il block off ! 
we should the Horizont can see ... ... there , where' s the earth krümmt . 
we' re up enough , we have the sea here , right ? 
we should " Big Island " can see . 
it' s just 30 miles away . 
and , as you can see , behind it is not blauer heaven . 
this is the key ! 
that' s all , you know , it' s this strange blue ... ... flute of blue what I call it . 
and this is this a nice day . 
you know , there' s no blue sky more . 
we' il watch us today , the stars . 
it' s like ... 
you' re gonna see . 
you can they ZÄHLEN ! 
so many stars are now at night to see ! 
there should be hunderttausende stars , and you can they ZÄHLEN ! 
one here , a there ... ... a Planet here , it' s like ... 
sometimes you can' a hundred see in some other night only ZEHN ! 
this is what worries me . 
this stuff here . 
- that' s all WEICH ! 
- okay ... 
you can do this , just abziehen ! 
the bark ... ... that' s not of course ! 
I' ve never seen hunderttausende Kokosnüsse , but soetwas here ... ... they' re just break it up ! 
look at that , folks . 
soetwas I' ve ever seen . 
on " Big Island " I' ve always the trees gepflegt . 
something vergleichbares , how the here , I' ve ever seen . 
and that' s besorgniserregend for me . 
not easy to the you here on the island did . 
I could see the Skepsis because it' s beyond irgendeiner idea . 
it' s astonishing ! 
it' s amazing to go to the eyes of to look at other . 
in my eyes , I see that ... ... it' s like day and night . 
other people about it ... 
the illusion s derartig tiefgreifend ! 
what do you think would happen if everybody wakes up and ... ... can understand what' s wrong , what the plans ... ... that Klimaveränderer are ? 
I think ... I think I' d be a revolution give that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
if people would really understand what' s going on in there ... 
what are your Befürchtungen ... 
I know you in this country love ... 
what are your Befürchtungen ... ... ... to Chemtrails ? 
well , that we t live here anymore , and our own Lebensmittel anpflanzen can ... ... and that our health attacked will . 
- you think it' s already happened ? 
- yeah ! 
the fact is , that she make it every day ... every day . 
it' s a hämmern and hämmern and hämmern ... ... little tins of every day . 
and , of course , only gets it in the Umwelt . . . . . . and , of course , schwächt it the shoots . 
it needs a few years for it ... ... for the shoots to schwächen ... ... and then let' s ask for genveränderten Taro . 
then let' s ask for genveränderten Papaya ... ... because we our natürlichen seed no more anbauen can ! 
so we got a future ! 
we can' t really ... ... here live like this , like God created us has to be . 
so talked me into it a Haaranalyse my friend of my daughter to make . 
so I have a few hair of her Haaransatz , a few really new hair , taken away and eingeschickt . 
I was so sure that hair my daughter a unbelastet is through the Lebensweise , the we have here ... ... and from there , it came back and their charts were really up with Aluminium . 
this is the analysis . 
this is the Referenztabelle and this is the value my daughter . 
23, 1 with Aluminium . 
heaven is with a white fog covered and if I double aufsehe , I can the long , deep stars t see any more . . . . . . and I can' t different than me to do that thing with the health my daughter to do . 
I don' t know where this Schwermetalle or come here . 
- look just like old she is . 
she was here abgeschottet . 
- here ! - and she' s ... 
everybody here d feel like : 
this is this paradise ! 
- this child would be super- healthy as a horse ... 
- a ... ... place with biologischem Anbau ... 
- and here we have this whole Schwermetalle ! 
she has the höchsten chart at Aluminium ... ... and she' d no Impfung . 
friends , these people play God ! 
you play God and manipulieren the weather ... ... and she sprühen stuff in heaven ! 
you' re trying to change ALLES künstlich and your shoots , trees and even the sea ! 
so , tonight we hope that you don' t mind that instead of to ... ... anfangt you at that myself . 
because I really think of my heart believe we here a proper crisis . 
really ! 
you hurt me in 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere obere einzubringen . 
what causes Aluminium ? 
it' s gonna change that , pH balance of Bodens ... ... and that' s giftig for the Vegetation ! 
besides , it is very giftig for the human health ! 
do that really ? 
let me about my Erfahrungen tell and what we found . 
we have many have a lead , the not only assume so let ... ... but , like , I think prove that really these things happen . 
and as I promise , here' s our all spezieller guest : 
Michael J. Murphy , currently taking a place that picture was taken in Hawaii . 
he' s working on a Dokumentarfilm with the title : 
" what in the world are they spraying ? " ( what in the world versprühen the there ? ] 
Michael . welcome on camera . 
great , today with you to speak ! 
a friend of the other night ... ... he can see the things always from another Blickwinkel out . 
he' s a little such a ... Verschwörungstheoretiker ... ... and he says , whenever the President to L. A. come on , there' s a whole week no Sprühen . 
have a better place for an interview ? 
look at that ! 
it' s really ! 
about our Farmen and stuff . 
so , basically do they want your ability to unterbinden ... ... biological Lebensmittel to eat , clean Lebensmittel and bad water ... ... so kind of s that for me look ... ... of course , it' s just a Prognose ... ... for me sounds the to KONTROLLE ! 
" how controI we the masses . " 
how can Aluminium just kind of good for a his ... 
what was the second stuff you mentioned do ? 
- Barium ... 
- Barium and Aluminium . 
they' re obviously giftig ... ... for ALLES ! 
for the human health ... ... for people for Farmen , for animals for ALLES ! 
- 61. 000 split a billion ... 
and behördlicher alarm should be at 1 , 000 ? 
at 1 , 000 ! 
and people drink this . 
the people who the mountain besteigen ... 
you drink this time . 
this is poison . 
oh , my God ! 
that' s obnoxious . 
- well , that' s 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ? 
- that' s right . 
- 60. 000- fach about the Grenzwert ... 
I' m with friends in L. A. talking about ... 
" oh , it' s just ice ! 
that' s Kondensation . " 
and I say : 
a Zweitklässler know , ice are not that and breitet so out ! 
you' re not expert , but a besorgter citizens , the said : 
" wait a minute , I want ... " 
you recherchierst and that' s what we' re doing the Americans have to ... ... and say : 
" you know what ? 
I want to know what' s going on here ! " 
I want to know what the Lebensmittelbehörde with my Lebensmitteln is . 
I want to know what the government with the air , the water , the floor is ! 
it' s great , what you' re doing . 
my thanks to you because you light in this are ! 
let the whole Theorien Mason , really . 
what the Klima- Ingenieure suggest , and they find anything will is spooky enough ! 
so , we can beschränken us on , all this point anzusprechen ! 
and I ermutige more people vorzutreten and questions to ask ... doing what he does ! 
thank you , Michael . thank you , thank you very much . 
Ausbringung of Aluminium- Aerosolen be affected everywhere . 
we have a magnificent , tropisches Klima , that' s how I believe in danger may be . 
so , we' re not just come here and the news I think the people in the world found ... ... but , people ermutigen even after Aluminium , Strontium and Barium to test . 
basically , I think it was a wirkungsvolle trip . 
I' ve got a lot of people here in Hawaii , in Maui , wake up , see , not just curious , but , gewillt weiterzuforschen . . . . . . and this is my only option . 
I think that' s one of the mutigsten trains of Ed Griffin ... ... until now . 
it' s the Tabu- subject , talk about the no one should ... ... and that' s Aerosol- Sprühungen ! 
we have tonnenweise dokumentierte Nachweise about Aerosol- Sprühaktionen . 
' it easy for me ! that Grundwesen of humanity was always in the sky hinaufzusehen and to ask : 
why ? 
no ! 
there' s no boundaries ! 
the room and the universe are endlos ! 
but now in the 21st century we can' t do it any more ! 
everybody , the aufsieht and the huge Gitternetze and the X- e the sky looks ... ... the until of a or two Jahrzehnten no part of our Daseins were ... ... is aufeinmal for crazy explain ! 
and the people who the best and greatest Verfechter the freedom is ... ... don' t want that you talking about , because it in her Misskredit get could ! 
it appears as if there' s a whole Wirtschaftszweig built ... ... to the Steuerzahler to melken by a sort of weltweites Sprüh- raised s program ... ... for a lot of money with this project to scheffeln ... ... and it seems to keep her t see what could have effects this . 
you do not find out if the humanity that can survive or like that . 
you want this stuff just there hinaufkriegen ... ... and DANN , after we leave it that way to we' re ... ... that it companies , there' s the on the fuck happened to Organismen profit ... ... seed , the fuck happened to Getreidesamen , the changed ... ... to the Aluminium in the floor to resist getting . 
many Getreidearten grow not in such a area . 
so , after her up the Böden have ... ... have the peasants go to them ... ... and the seed buy , the gentechnisch changed for the Aluminium to resist getting that in the Böden , Margie . . . . . . and was urplötzlich s humanity a abhängig of this companies like Monsanto and other this huge Agrarkonzerne . 
you can' t even more natural seed anbauen ! 
and we' il see this on ! 
it' s a schockierende thing ! 
I hope we do not tight , that is true , but ... ... now indicates all on down ! 
we' ve got a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because H. A. A. R. P. [ high active Auroral Research Program : too hiermit in context are could ... ... Geo- Engineering - how you angemerkt have - this in there' s a man named Dennis Kucinich´s Gesetzesvorlage ... ... the " space Preservation Act " often angeführt will ... ... the last I heard , not from the Congress - that was nice of ya got . 
and then Key Bail- out - we like it here call - Kay Bailey Hutchinson ... ... the also a couple of law zusammengestellt has to Engineering Geo- in power to sit ... ... something all of us as I said , before the Klimaerwärmung save you . 
it' s a Kosten/ Nutzen- bill , because she look like so many Aspekten good through can move ! 
- Ed , this is what they all , don´t you don' t ! 
- that' s it ! 
there' s this old proverb . 
" follow the money ! " that you üblicherweise the core of the Problems get ... ... and for me , it looks just like this just a ungemein profitable industry be built ... ... rund about this concept " Geo- Engineering " or " Wettermanipulation " or " Reduzierung the Erderwärmung " ... ... and all the other things , the a ahnungslosen public pretty just can be sold . 
" oh , that' s right . 
we want no Klimaerwärmung ... " ... and so they do with you . 
and they don' t ask any questions , re not critical ... ... but in the Hinterzimmern can you see a entire industry built will ... ... the way I say , ungeheuer profitabel is ... ... and all the money ... ... comes from the Steuerzahler ! 
it' s a cheating . 
it' s still basically the ! 
and we focus on this a subject , that' s very easy to prove is : 
on this area there' s no Spekulation . 
you are definitely this Geo- through Engineering . 
you speak definitely about it . 
you work at the Methoden for it . 
you work for the Strategien out . 
you have the Budget for it . 
everything is in position . 
we need t even more aspects , of course anzusprechen to lock the case . 
well , are people her Theorien believe . 
but at least they have to understand that out of the question is , will want to discuss this . 
well , if they should , don' t be as alarmiert about what plan is to do ? 
it can be proven , that Barium and Aluminium and the other giftigen Metalle a very destructive damage on the planet and the people did . 
won' t that ? 
how many aspects , of course , we have to got some reinquetschen ? 
well , if planned s the planet and the population to kill , we need you have any other reason for alarmiert to be ? 
" what in the world are they spraying ? " thank God , make people that question ! 
we don' t want any more . 
we only want to ask the questions . 
our good friend , G Edward Griffin . 
and Mike Murphy and Paul Wittenberger ... ... make this great bid with your help . 
that' s a Gemeinschaftsanstrengung to RICHTIGE information to the people to do . 
" what in the world are they ? " spraying a few more Abschlußworte before our time for ? 
the Abschluß betone I nocheinmal that we have to that question : 
" what in the world are they spraying ? " 
and now WISSEN us what it is . 
and people , it' s not like you ! 
I' m Peter Vereeke . 
I' m from Belgium . 
I' m 54th years old . 
I can' t believe it yourself . 
I' m a very happy and dankbarer man . 
we' il do the job , the police , that Justizministerium or the Umweltamt had to do . 
- and it' s very important that this a Grassroots- revolution ( of the basis ) will . 
- I think so too . - because we don' t GEGEN , but FÜR fight ! 
- yeah , we' re in FÜR ! 
I was 25 years in the selectmen and a Legislaturperiode as mayor . 
from this moment - 10 years ago - did everything begun to change . 
I started to get a picture of it , what really will have expired . 
I was completely clear that we - humanity - ... ... and ausgebeutet are fouled , keeps ... ... and the for centuries ! 
this Chemtrail- phenomenon made me mad because I was so helpless . 
you can decide what Lebensmittel you eat ... ... what you smoked , which water you drink ... ... which lives you live ... ... but not with this phenomenon . 
then you' re just a victim . 
it' s just a game . 
and it must give the good boys and the bad guys . 
and luckily , we' re in the spot the matter of good to play ... ... the ... the chance and the chance to have these Herausforderung überwinden . 
the three days , the we with them teilten , brought my heart leap because it' s such a beautiful way to live . 
and so a ... restful way to live . 
at the departure , I ask me , as it there in 10 years look like . 
destroy everything will be on their Grundstück ? 
and if yeah , what is it your Lebensgrundlage be ? 
you' il have to let himself zertifizieren of irgendeiner company XYZ ? 
and what would the Voraussetzungen for it ? 
that' s the end of the freedom ! 
that worries me very ! 
very ! 
I' ve learned here' s what to say . 
" everything was going so , what it' s like ... " " ... and everything' s going to be all right ! " 
- it' il be all right . 
- everything' s going to be all right . 
- yeah ! 
I have this tiefe feeling that we at the end of victorious il be ... ... because we the right on our side . 
the Kosmos help us ! 
and I have this strong feeling that we of Wesenheiten re supporting ... ... and of Mächten , the we' re not even sure you can . 
well , for the first time we' ve got the wissenschaftlichen record ... ... that we WIRKLICH besprüht will . 
we' il besprüht ! 
it' s unbelievable and hard vorstellbar ... ... but we' re besprüht ! 
I think at this point stehenzubleiben , s no OPTION ! 
if you even know and a tool like this ve got a chance like this ... ... that this Chemtrails- thing or persistente Flugzeug- Kondensstreifen or , as usual , you want to call ... ... that this phenomenon than REAL recognized il ! 
in a public Debatte ! 
in the context with Geo- Engineering it' s five- vor- Zwölf that to get to the public . 
so was the sky look . 
that' s old paintings . 
we have the forget , I' m afraid . 
in those years ... ... in which I a journalist in the Medizinforschung tätig was ... ... I have many , many things here . 
whatever I ... have , I found always the same three aspects , of course . 
we' il dümmer done ... ... we' re sick done ... ... and we' re unfruchtbar done . 
people from the world at or around this time ... ... down here in Belgium the first International Chemtrails- Symposium . 
this one did führende Fachkräfte , politicians and Aktivisten hergeführt ... ... to Gesundheits - , Umwelt - and social aspects , of course this Programme to discuss . 
it' s today just to ... ... with the full facts , Goodspeed , documents , numbers , Patente , Lizenzen ... ... all leads us to the truth . 
we don' t have any other weapon against these huge Komplex ... ... than that Aufdecken this düsteren works in Lichte the truth . 
however , we hope that through our Anstrengungen more and more people the fact ... ... recognise that we of our Führern hinters light geführt will . 
we' re today than family zusammengekommen ... ... to our powers to join with the people here re here , at the world to show that Chemtrails no Verschwörungs- theory ... ... but a Verschwörungs- TATSACHE are ! 
from the Technischen university Delft in Holland ... ... ladies and gentlemen , please and you : 
Coen Vermeeren ! 
my name is Coen Vermeeren . 
I' m Professor at the Technischen university Delft . 
üblicherweise have the people their heads in the sand ... ... in her own zwei- dimensionalen room and see t upstairs . 
but if they do , they' re more and more room like this see . 
it' s me , too . was he playing ? 
I' ve got my students no explanation for this Phänomene give can . 
so I' ve had to her myself ... ... and in that I could give them no answer . 
because I think that this phenomenon not NATÜRLICH is . 
what goes on here is not NATÜRLICH . 
and the explain the give us were , re not zufriedenstellend for me . 
betrachtet you something from the wissenschaftlichen tone of he' s first step to try something to explain . 
I' m smart , my students re not quite so smart ... ... so I had these answers to deliver . 
but , if she most scientists an honest question to this admit that t seem them on all the answers . 
if anybody Klima- Manipulation over our heads durchführt , then I want to know . I want the consequences know . 
I want the Gesundheitsrisiken know . 
I want to know all about it . 
when teacher at my university I have the job my students answers to deliver . 
and they have good questions ... ... on the I don' t have the answers ... 
- ... and I wanna know ! 
- fantastic ! 
and we' re gonna discuss it ! 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
for you here in Auditorium and for the world . 
Michael Murphy . 
thank you , thank you very much . 
it' s a great honor , here in Belgium to be ! 
people at the power controI all ! 
they controI the Märkte , they controI us ... ... and now controI you even the weather ! 
and she can use it for kriegerische sole purpose . 
the only thing they don' t controI can do ... ... is what God profit has : 
and that' s natürliches , biological Saatgut . 
the name is " hierfür Hegels Dialektik . " 
problem - reaction - solution ( to Hegel : 
- Antithese - Synthese ) These 
the problem here are huge Mengen Aluminium . 
everything begins abzusterben . 
the solution to come from company X , they said : 
" hey , guys ! 
your shoots re not Erträge ! " 
" all die ! " 
" but we have the solution . 
we have Saatgut , I am under your terms it grows . " 
" the only issue is ... 
now need you to buy MIR ! " 
we' re fond of me , that could be a part of this Agenda , all of course , and a biologic s abzutöten ... ... and to change on ! ... with genmanipuliertem Saatgut , that against Aluminium resistent is . 
like some maybe know , we just got back of a week Filmdreh in Hawaii ... ... it was an incredible trip . 
people there are very worried because she keep an eye on that their Kokosnussbäume get sick . 
her Besorgnis is that this Programme a part of a great Agenda could be ... ... for all Natürliche , Organische to destroy . 
that in the end genveränderte Lebensmittel the Großkonzerne her only Nahrungsquelle are . 
I didn' t expect that so many people , young and old ... ... on this phenomenon re interested ... ... and about it worries are . 
especially gave me the safety of the young girl like today ... ... only 17 and a speech of audience haltend . 
that' s incredible ! 
my name is Sophia Xenidis . 
I' m 5 years old . 
it' s creepy to know that the air , the we breathe , not that' s how it should be . 
that the Lebensmittel , the we eat , the water we drink , tracks this substances contains ... ... the about us versprüht be as if we insects it ! 
the feelings in the me auslöst are tiefe feelings of anger and rage ! 
I don' t want to be poisoned ! 
I don' t want to be krebserregenden Stoffen infiziert . 
it makes me so angry , that world- Vergiften , in a so gigantischen amount , always keep s ... ... and not enough s done to this crime Einhalt to gebieten . 
a klare answer to a question : 
we' il besprüht ? 
we were besprüht ? 
and it' s always the purpose us to keep besprühen ? 
what are we gonna do about it ? 
how are we gonna handle it ? 
how are we gonna stop it ? 
I know the answer to my question ! 
there' s only one person that can stop and you know who this is ! 
you BIST ES ! 
you BIST ES ! 
the person on the you have been waiting for . 
we' re great , wonderful , divine being ! 
ladies and gentlemen ! 
sisters and brothers in the Auditorium and in the world ... 
thank you , thank you very much , that you were here with us here ! 
and now , enjoy yourself with this song ! 
hello ! 
good to see you ! 
come in ! 
I sure am glad you were good weather , until now . 
all right , move it back before we do in the winter . 
if you go to Washington on , would you in snow to land . 
- thank God , we needn' t do it ! 
- that' s right . 
you know , with this weather - Veränderungsprogrammen it' s strange . 
I guess it' s as about 32 alone in the American Festland ! 
so , the theory is that Geo- Engineering too on something to do with Wetter- Manipulation . 
that' s an interesting point , Mike ! 
it' s soviele Untergruppen with this subject Geo- Engineering connected . 
people my orders are to contact us the whole time ... ... with information to close with Klimaerwärmung , connections with Wettermanipulation ... 
some people think you are , there' s a connection to the Morgellons- illness , at all . 
other again think it' s around a approach to transmission of elektro- magnetic Impulsen ... ... of H. A. A. R. P. Antennensystems up in Alaska and Sibirien . 
there' s one of the head of to humming and every issue of seems to be an investigation worth ... ... but we have so little time . 
I think it' s smart for us , that we' il concentrate our efforts to the Sprühprogramme ... ... and the Giftigkeit this Chemikalien , and the destruction of the planet and the Gesundheitsschäden ! 
what we need more than the to the people to convince that we stop have to ? 
so , I think it' s important that we' il concentrate our efforts to it . 
Jeremy , we had there an idea . 
we know that you the political system really good know . 
the idea is following : 
we have here tonnenweise data and information , the we on the transportation gesammelt . 
we believe a good way that movie lock , if this subject with ... ... gewählten deputy and politicians anzusprechen . 
so , we have asked us here' s what . 
if you could come and help us there ... ... and shows us maybe we like it on the political level can do . 
that sounds like a good idea ... ... and I' m gonna look at me with what people we' il talk about it best . 
if we make it at least ... ... it for her impossible to make to say that they know nothing about ... ... and their way to take a Kenntnis the Sachlage abzustreiten , the on Geo- Engineering hindeutet ... ... and on already laufende Aerosol- Sprühprogramme . 
at least should it right interesting in " District the Kriminalität " ... with a few people Warnglocken off to let . 
you have a lot of enemies to Washington . 
there bündelt up the whole power ... ... and the money . 
well , that' s sure people who don' t want you this job is . 
but I' m glad you' il ... ... you' il see what' s happening ! 
we were taking the facts to Washington DC , where we put the gewählten Regierungsvertretern next letter . 
according to the fifth Zusatzartikel the Constitution ... ... the United States of America ... ... may one person life ... ... with or property without a tight Gerichtsverfahren be taken . 
the täglichen Sprühaktionen but , entziehen ALLEN Bürgern the Vereinigen States life , health , freedom and Unversehrtheit ... ... without vorheriges , tight Gerichtsverfahren . 
when Repräsentant the people of the United States of America ... ... house we on that they all in her power air do for us to protect and a sofortigen Stop that Geo- Engineering Sprühungen to erwirken ! 
it exist no Rechtfertigung , not il be legal still in other way , the planet and his people to poison . 
get us from , Außerirdische come on the ground , maybe down to land she at the United Nations headquarters or maybe you choose a klügeren place ... ... anyway , let' s get to it to land and give us a school . 
and this school has two Drehknöpfe : 
with a button can you the temperature on the ground that ... ... and with the second button the CO² Konzentration . 
you can imagine that we about this case will lead wars ... ... because we have no way to us to negotiate , where we the regulator sit down . 
no Weltordnungspolitik . . . . . . and different people have different come true , where they the regulator want . 
Sonneneinstrahlungs- Manipulation s like Chemotherapie : 
nobody wants her ! 
but we all want to get another chance for the other side got it to make and her risks to understand ... ... we should be in the situation of a dangerous cancer to suffer . 
- how long does it take up there ? 
- years , a couple of years ... 
- and then what ? 
it' s raining down ? 
- yeah , that' s correct . 
- don' t schädlichen Nebenwirkungen , of which she know ? 
- what we always ask , that' s Unbekannte of we don' t know . 
- I understand . 
if it on Versauerung think it' s no problem . 
there' s some Studien , the belegen . 
but the concern of course , there is so little that with research ... ... ... maybe a - re not familiar - Unbekanntes out of the blue , and makes us . 
my name is Mike Murphy . 
I' m Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we hear a subject with the name " Geo- Engineering . " 
we had a fast question the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
I' m afraid I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
we were ask if they the theories the Klimawissenschaftler support ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere auszubringen ? 
- I should really first Informationsmaterial before I have my opinion ... 
- no problem . you know the subject ? 
- no , not totally ... 
- Überhaupt ? - no 
this is a letter from Wählern , people are concerned . 
- what are you ... 
- we dokumentieren the Geschehnisse . 
- well , I don' t know . 
you have a Legitimation to be here ? 
- yeah , we got it ! 
we' re also the Security- Check through . - ... ... in through our Creator ... 
- well , I don' t think so . 
- please you don' t touch me ! 
- you ... ... they lie ! - no , do we do not . 
what should we lied ? 
- no , come on , hurry it up . ... 
- what are we have lied to the court ? 
that was a little strange , right ? 
- I don' t have anything about it is , no , no , no . 
- okay 
and it looks like , so if this Programme already go ... 
I got me a proposition t carefully ... ... let me look at that ? 
- I can' to do ! 
do you know ... 
- actually , I have to go ... 
- can we talk to her ? 
- yes ? ... 
no ... 
let me get it . right . 
I' il me check it out . 
I' il watch me that ... ... and then help deal . 
- Herr General ! 
this program . this open Geheim- program , Aerosol - Sprühprogramm , " Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering " ( SAG ) , ( SAG= Stratosphärische Aerosol- Sprühungen ] 
- what ? - tons Aluminium in the sky sprühen ... 
- I have no idea what you' re talking about . 
- okay . 
- it' s üblicherweise " Chemtrails called " ... Sir ? 
- come on , hurry it up . 
- when you the Director of NIMA * were , have you seen the Aerosol- flick ? ( Nima = National Imagery and Mapping Agency ) - no . 
Mike Murphy , Filmemacher from Los Angeles . 
we hear the subject " Geo- Engineering " ... ... and we wanted to know if your theories the Klimawissenschaftler support ? 
- Congressman ? 
- hello , people . 
we wanted to know if your theories the Klimawissenschaftler support ... ... ten to 20 million tons Aluminium in the atmosphere auszubringen ? 
- I' m not familiar with it . 
- I beg your pardon ? 
- I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
- I don' t know what you' re talking about . 
- okay . - put the question in my office ... 
I' m not Anhänger ... 
I didn' t ... it to me very carefully . 
- I didn' t ... 
- did you hear about the subject , because ... ... there will be a public statement now , in the mass media come and Kongress- Kommitees in il about this Programme to discuss . 
I think before there' s anything we can get in the atmosphere before the effects , we should know , isn' t it ? 
- yeah ! 
- and if we don' t know what effects it is , we should t do it . 
I think we have four ways if we about the choice of Geo- Engineering think about it . 
the first is : 
we verbieten it easy ! 
I' d argumentieren , that you ... ... not on the basis for little Studien to restriktiv should be ... ... since the hands of science hook would . 
I think the scientific community Versuche in kleinem Maßstab durchzuführen in this ... " section " ... and it is a scientific question , what exactly this " section " should be ... 
it wasn' t too much Beaufsichtigung and Beschränkung give ... 
Mr. politician ? 
excuse me . 
I' m Mike Murphy of L. A. We at the subject " Geo- Engineering . " 
these people run away from this Geo- Engineering thing . 
I wonder why ? 
- I gotta talk to my Mitarbeitern talk about it now . 
I know the details . 
- did you have someone on the subject s kind do ? - , sir ? 
Mr. politician , has anyone ever with you on this subject Geo- Engineering spoken , last November ? 
you' re a Befürworter this theories ? 
we would you like to give papers about it . 
- about what ? - Geo- Engineering ? 
you know anything about that Geo- Engineering subject ? 
no . never heard of it . 
this is something about the I never heard of . 
when we today in the sky say we have that already , here . 
- do you have never heard of Geo- Engineering ? 
- no . 
the theories noisy 10 million tons Metalle in the air to fire . 
the Komitee for science and technology , that' s the first time s ... no ? 
- no , never heard of it . 
- well , we were very fond of me . 
- hi , how are you ? 
I' m fine . 
- well , what is it ? 
- we have to the office of Kongressmitglied Watson spoken ... ... and their Pressesprecherin , Fr . White was familiar with the Gesetzesentwurf " space Preservation Act " the Abgeordneten there' s a man named Dennis Kucinich ... ... the Chemtrails and the Militarisierung of atmosphere and galaxy mentioned has ... ... later they found some pressure , this from the Gesetzesentwurf to streichen . . . . . . ... do you have the Aerosol Sprühungen about the Capitol today , see ? 
- politician ? 
- I' il get to them later ... 
Geo- Engineering is there a tremendous Bandbreite to Unsicherheiten , ethische and political Bedenken ... ... and the potential for katastrophale Nebenwirkungen on the Umwelt . 
he' s not one of the very often interviews is , so ... 
- well , do you think not the breath on . 
when Chairman of Komitees for Gerichtsbarkeit ... ... I feel obliged to a public argument about anzustoßen and a report/ ratio about Geo- Engineering anzulegen . 
we want to know if you' re a Unterstützer the Maßnamen , 10 to 20 million tons Aluminium ... 
- no ! - ... ... in the atmosphere to sprühen ? 
- no ! 
I think we need more research . 
okay . 
and about the aktuellen bid ? 
there' s linear a mountain to Beweisen , the - how many people believe - nachweist that this Programme already in the bid is . 
- you know anything about that ? 
- no . 
it' s safe to drive around here a mountain to Beweisen . 
but I unterstütze research towards Geo- Engineering and besides unterstütze I it , a internationale administration whose anzudenken . 
everyone that ... ... has know ... 
I think that this radikale theories re and I hope we don' t have use ... ... but it might the time come on the we have forced are . 
if we could you evidence vorlegen the belegen that this Programme already go re and JETZT go ... ... ... would you do that , then got no need to language do ? 
we had already 3 , 4 Meetings ... Sitzungen to this subject . 
we have that angesprochen a public statement . 
well , not the theories , but the aktuelle bid this Programme . 
I unterstütze the aktuellen bid t . 
I think we need more research . 
the consequences could have the about a country hinausgehen ... ... and I think we were also the question s the guidance . 
guidance s not just a subject during the Einsatzes , but VOR the bid ... ... especially in Hinblick on großangelegte Feldversuche . 
I' il admit that it on this subject and generell not to be seen , about world- Reglemente to speak . 
when these people started , about the Notwendigkeit a Aufsicht through the United Nations Security Council to speak , ... ... a über- national Umweltsicherheits- Behörde with a strong Mandat the United Nations ... 
it' s all right , that she for a years of world power to the Manipulation the Umwelt re looking for . 
but I think it' il have to be a sort of internationaler contract , the every nation in a common fate lash . 
it' s a common destiny . 
unfortunately , it' s not just big know this , that could do . 
too little know this . 
or Milliardäre ... ... the possibly say , " I' il save the world , all alone and make me not the trouble , this to mention . " 
how decide we when we have a world- Notsituation ? 
whose hand is the Thermostat ? 
how decide we when we do with this ? 
aktuell we have no way to do it . 
and what if we start and then a problem with technique or the angle sodaß we have no longer durchführen can ? 
in a or two years come the Aerosole from the atmosphere and the Temperaturen il go then much faster than right now . 
it' s these Veränderungsrate , the it' s hard to make us anzupassen . 
so if we even begun to have we will be forced it for long , long time durchzuführen ... ... basically without end in sight . 
Boeing d after streben this profit to tie , right ? 
I mean , there' s a finanzielle angle that to do ? 
hmm , let' s see ... 
so , don' t let me speak for Boeing . 
- is that don' t mind ? 
- well , it' s what it is . 
but one day , when the United States decide to do this , they' il find a Konzern , that could ... ... and she would there be aufgestellt ... ... Boeing d better have the sanction instead of him Lockheed Martin drink it . 
of course , we have the industrielle basis for that the country help himself Technologien and big a challenge , beispielsweise Landesverteidigung , I suppose . 
and we' il do the both of Profitgründen than ... than service for the country . 
I think it would be really verheerend if we in a few years to get it a Geheimprogramm gave , and some government ... ... to answer would have to the Stillen to learn how to bewerkstelligen is . 
it' s pretty clear , that you can the planet cool , but they can and will not the same Klima can return to the she started . 
I suppose they have - or neither - a lot for and Wider with the question how sinnvoll it' s the risks the Klimaveränderung to vermindern . 
I think how did good have a lead that it could be useful , but we don' t exactly know ... 
but it doesn' t she sure to that' s demselben Klima back to the she started . 
hierin are s all einig . 
- do you think we have the bid to our in life ? 
- I' m saying : 
I hope not . 
- Al ? 
- I agree . 
I hope not . 
- I sure hope not . 
I can see this as a sort of Rettungsplan ... ... than ... ... you know ... gewissermaßen the brig big Deiche ... ... maybe Emissionsreduktionen to try to stop them s the auszulöschen . . . . . . . but if they should , she' s coming gewissermaßen do what to do ... ... in case like a disaster . 
so I see these Optionen more than Katastrophen - Notfallplan and not a possibility of Verminderung the risks the täglichen Klimaveränderung . 
you would a Verminderung of Fleischkonsums befürworten a chance when you try to reach ? 
- ähh ... ... yes ! 
- how do you suggest that we umzusetzen ? 
you can' t ... I can' t ... 
it' s your job to decide what to besteuert and what t . 
obviously , if they' d like that people her behavior change , give them these Anreize or Abschreckungen for your behaviour ... 
- that was sure the answer , they wanted to hear , Mr. Smith . 
- lf only my time t past is . 
because literally putting on the whole world Aluminium and Barium Verseuchung be found ... ... and they think it' s coming from this Programmen . 
see you tonight , about the capital , they look like Aerosole ausgebracht will . 
have you seen it ? 
- no , but I can see it . 
in the James Bond script is a rich bad planes aufsteigen to the Wolken to impfen . 
how can you help ? 
- I' il like to talk to you . 
just call my office on . 
- okay , you know the subject ? 
- how say , Termine about the office . 
- are you a Befürworter this theories ? 
how are you say , pal ? 
- I ... I don' t know anything about it and I' m late . 
- I have to a hearing . 
- okay , we' il get you a letter about it . 
- that' s a letter to her voters ... 
- I' il take that ! 
- that' s wonderful ! ... ... and a lot of people think this Programme already go , because massive Verseuchungen been found . 
- I don' t know what they with " these Programme " mean . 
one , two words say ... - Geo- Engineering Programme . 
- Geo- Engineering . hab´s understood ! 
which plane versprühen . 
so what happened here' s what . 
people in the world find Verseuchungen ... 
- I' il take care of it . 
I speak with them when I get back . 
- thank you . 
we see , even if we the Durchschnittstemperatur about right , communication can be felt the Niederschlagsmuster to be today , but change . 
some places to be a little warmer and some places going . 
well , it' s winner and loser hit this Geo- Engineering activity , if we do it ... ... but nichtsdestotrotz , like David already said : 
there' s reasons why we should consider . 
a lot of people are heavy worried about about the Giftigkeit of Aluminium , what do in several Komitees on angesprochen was . 
would you please a look at this letter of some your voters re the these Bedenken anspricht . 
- excuse me , I have to go ... 
- okay , can I give you a letter from Wählern . 
you know of the Vorschlägen about the Versprühen ... 
- I' m a little late . 
- I see . 
thank you . 
well , I don' t know about that bescheid , so I don' t know what to do . 
okay ! 
so the Geo- Ingenieure hit me , Womack , Aluminium and Barium in the atmosphere to get ... 
why would you do that ? 
Aluminium s a wertvolles metal we can use . 
well , that would explain target is it , the planet to cool , however , there' s ... 
sounds strange . 
- right , right ! 
so , they make of this Metalle in the air too little bubbles in principle to the Sonnenstrahlung abzuhalten ... 
we' re here to find out what the Kongressmitglieder ... 
- I hope we have a serious hearing about it , before you decide to do this . 
- I hope it ! ... ... and there' s ausreichende have a lead , the not just andeuten that this Programme already in the bid is , ... ... because we Aluminium - and Barium- Verunreinigungen in the rain , snow and floor find . 
- okay , thanks ! 
- thank you . 
L. A. County has a hundred percent - igen Anstieg with Alzheimer- occasions in the past decade verzeichnet . 
many reason - and Wasserproben show big values of Aluminium in the entire Bundesstaat . 
why don' t you give me all the information , they have . 
I have some very good elements that I' m so beauftragen . 
- and if you to Mr. Lavelle go ... 
- okay ... 
he' s my card . send me a Email , and we' il ... 
we' il stay in contact . 
we' re checking the and there' s literally putting a man of Hinweisen , the nahelegen that this Programme . 
schieben give us the mountain over there and we will you check it out . 
- lf you in the sky see , you' il win some ... 
- okay ... 
you' re ! 
you can' t quite see how this Aerosole of the aircraft versprüht il ... 
well , thank you very much . 
the future of humanity are a lot of us off . 
we count on people like you ... ... the a few Initiativen all . 
thank you , thank you , guys ! 
- all right ! 
thank you . 
a lot of Kongressmitglieder s the lead out runtergelaufen and has to doors in the Gängen been looking for the questions auszuweichen ... 
well , obviously is the war against all of us , and we are all in a Geisellage ... 
people an oath schworen , the Constitution hochzuhalten and defend , don' t know is that this happen , but beteiligen to even about it . 
and we all have the duty vorzutreten and our mind to say . 
why is the water verseucht ? 
why is the earth verseucht ? 
why get sickness of the context with Aluminium in there and all of us betroffen do ? 
and so we' ve all the duty vorzutreten and auszusprechen to informieren and this to stop , in our own terms and the our children . 
this is a entscheidender moment in the history of the world ! 
we men have to determine whether we want to live on our knees ... ... while we every day besprüht and envenomed il ... ... and under ständiger threat or if we live up and live as free people ... ... the to truth , justice , peace and freedom of all streben ... ALLE children of God ! 
as you can see , we finish our movie here in Washington DC . 
we have a lot of Regierungsbeamte on this hingewiesen . 
most have either every Kenntnis abgestritten ... ... or were just not ready with us to talk about the situation . 
now , as you can see , that' s behind the White House ... ... we have the Aerosole . 
the Sprühen s weitergegangen . 
what' s the answer ? 
settles it here in Washington , DC ? 
bound to . 
that' s one of the solutions , but the answer is not just here . 
the answer is in DIR ! 
this subject concerning all of us deeply . 
now , look in your Innerstes . 
please , will operational . 
in you . 
catch on it weiterzusagen with steigendem Bewußtsein . 
we believe that over 90 % of the population about it in Unkenntnis re ... ... and that means that 90 % of the people , they usually do something would ... ... if she' d know , but t do it , because she nichtsahnend are . 
now , look at your heart . 
use your choices , what this is about the message to are . 
the future of humanity depends on !

the smell the dead was like poison in the air . 
a dreadful , predatory and erbarmungsloser than the war , was about us hereingebrochen . 
a Pestseuche , the half of our Königreiches dahinraffte . 
where did they get here ? 
how verbreitete them ? 
the priest told us , she was the sentence of God . 
but for what sin ? 
what bid , we had broken that we deserve had something ? 
no , we knew the truth . 
it wasn' t God' s work , but Teufelei ... ... or witchcraft . 
and our job was in it , for the healing by God the Dämon to catch . 
brother Thomas ! 
brother Thomas ! 
- who was us on ? 
- brother Ignatius . 
- was it the Pest ? 
- that was us t say . 
I didn' t sign . 
please brother . 
let me out . 
Averill . 
thank God you' re in safety . 
- where were you ? 
- locked him up . you found me sick . 
- I asked you for dead ' . - it' s fine . 
I was praying for you . 
the whole time . 
I' m fine . take it easy . 
I' ve brought you something to eat . 
one of our brothers have died , Averill is this morning . 
even the cloisters won' t shield you . you have to get out of here . 
you gotta stay in the forest of Dentwich hiding until it' s over . 
Sunday has the Abt say the Pest be of God , have been for our sins wegzuwaschen . 
- Bestraft us God ? 
- no . 
you gotta go now . 
you have to go back to Dentwich . 
you gotta go now . 
- Osmund , I ... 
- you kiIled else , Averill . 
and don' t you ? 
come on . 
if I' m leaving the cloisters now , it' s for me , my God . 
you got it on them . 
you know that Märtyrerkreuz in the forest of Dentwich ? 
I wait for a week every morning , there on you . 
and then I' m gone . 
forgive me , Father , I' m confused . 
I confess , I' m going - and hergerissen . 
I can get out of this Mauern serve ? 
I' d go away from here , but you never of your way abkommen . 
show me your sake . 
father , give me a sign . 
I' m Ulric , Gesandter Archbishop' s . 
what now I say can never outside this Mauern dringen . 
the Bishop has to hear that a village not so s like everybody else . 
it' s the speech about it , it was a Zufluchtsort before the Pest . 
many villages re not yet from the Pest been destroyed . 
it means that Dorfbewohner entziehen felt the icy air of handle of Death . 
then she felt sure are in great Abwegen . 
we' re us in difficult time . 
such Behauptungen , if they still so amazing be can Gebildeten with less than us both Gehör find . 
so we just drop Gerüchten and the Aberglauben t aneim . 
God has his people don' t seem right under control . 
we must see to it that the herd not in Versuchung out of this incident , outside the church and God' s Geboten to Antwon' ten to re looking for . 
I have to see yourself as this village the Pest revenge . 
what have we get to make ? 
the village that I' m looking for , s the big one Moor . 
I wanted a leader , a Gottesmann , the me the way weist . 
this is there anybody , the a this job gewachsen would be . 
with the blessing Archbishop' s can I borrow any here auswählen . 
but , of respect for you , I let you the choice . 
I can you hinführen . 
no , he' s just a Novize . 
- it will require more experience . 
- let speak to him now . 
you said that gesuchte village leaving me in big drink Moor . 
I swelled in the corner , in the forest of Dentwich , and you know me out . 
he verfügt about the from me geforderten Erfahrungen . 
you will lead us . 
we' re in the Morgengrauen on . 
Osmund , this man is dangerous than the Pest . 
father , I got to have a lead praying . 
God gave me geantwon' tet . 
even if you überlebst , will you change the world out there . 
maybe I' d like to the point , Father . 
I lived with my beloved in freudiger sin now s my dearest a geschwärzte skin 
my dearest , and I Liebten us so brave well verrottet my dearest it' s so early in the grave 
we have our leader . 
God has no more men left . he sent us a boy . 
- think you can handle it , son ? 
- I can you hinführen . 
pray so that you can . 
the cut every through the ass to the throat . 
what is this ? 
how much he knows ? 
Ulric was right knauserig with the truth , can you say . 
this village , in that we travel ... ... you have God abgeschafft . 
a Dämon has his place eingenommen . 
it' s called , victim il make people eat people and dead stand back on . 
we' il get us the leader . . . . . . then follow confession , trial , the execution . 
the Bishop want to himself with a Totenbeschwörer to court go . 
what' s a Totenbeschwörer ? 
that' s for the dead of the cold ground get and them new life einaucht . 
we have the equipment , we' ve got the sake . 
we travel in the hell . 
- but God take us . - you got me a mistake . 
come back to your nunnery , if you fooled you feel . 
or come on and verrichte the work of God . 
let' s the thing clear up soon . let' s aufbrechen ! 
and you , too , Swire . 
we' re not as bad as you think . 
we' re worse . 
but we need you alive . 
you seem to know how these other the life holds . 
I was long in the king' s army , together with Wolfstan and handle . 
I' il tell honest . 
we' ve got the Dämon ever seen . but we have , like it' s coming . 
- what happened to him ? 
- Ivo was trapped . 
he talked not , and so have him the French your tongue rausgerissen . 
- and he ? 
- Mold have to leave you alone , unless a Blutbad must be done . 
and Dlaywag , that' s a Folterer , a hanging judge . it is , he is also a murderer , thief , and Vergewaltiger . 
but this he' s a good man . 
what about Ulric ? 
I got a wife and child . 
I' m here because of the money . 
Ulric s here because God has aufgetragen that to him . 
- m burning ! 
- have mercy ! please , have mercy ! no ! 
we have to help her . 
can you hear me ? 
you' ve earned it to burn . 
burn her ! 
burn the witch ! 
burn her ! 
you have sin about all of us , Margie ? - are you with the devil in Bunde . 
- what did she of illegal ? 
- you brought the death in our village . 
- the death you don' t have to ask . 
- it' s none of your business . 
go away . 
- I didn' t do nothing ! come on ! 
get out of the way ! 
- what kicks you the wife doing ? 
she' s our well poisoned , this is our half a village dead . 
I have our water bless you , with no one to of damage come on ! 
- I' ve done anything wrong ! 
- liar ! 
that dying started after them on the well was . 
- did she confessed ? 
- we all saw her gezaubert did . 
going to burn her that we save the rest of the village ! 
move . 
please you a second time . 
thank you . 
hold never on . 
come on , you Faulpelz . 
so sure , like sun on - and goes down , re witches burn . 
in a village to the north , there were 128 witches in one night verbrannt . 
that' s 8 hours 16 per hour . 
when the night was over , they had killed everyone women in the village . 
at the end of the week vögelten the men pigs . 
the Pest s enough not yet . God brings us to say , pigs to shag . 
ever been in the village that we' re looking for ? 
no . but I know where it is . 
the hell awaits us both . . . . . . that was told us . 
if you don' t have the guts , then go in , and right away I get your share of the reward . 
what does the church , how this Pest come ? 
I don' t think so , like so many that God us be punished . 
I say , she comes from France . . . . . . from there is all Übel . 
maybe you' re not even the truth close here , Swire . 
three Sommern we were fighting with Crecy in the Normandie . 
king Edwards army was zahlenmäßig unterlegen . 
in 20 of us were at least 100 French . 
and the French . oh , these Frenchmen ... 
you like a on the victory . you could smell him . 
but on that day took our Schützen this is the first one the Langbogen . 
the can be faster laden , the Pfeile re on . 
her Pfeile were no use . 
you couldn' t reach us . 
but our were like a dark , summende cloud . 
the night was the field with her dead and dying übersät . 
even in the toughest battle it' s usual , the Misericorde einzusetzen . 
the Misericorde s the " Barmherzigkeitsspender . " 
you trumped through the Achsel straight into the heart . 
quick and painless . 
but on that day there was no ritterliches behavior more . 
king Edward befahl , every French , the alive was without Barmherzigkeit to kill . 
poor , heads , legs , everything was abgehackt . 
the biggest Army has to a bunch of wild . 
forgive me , but what has that got to do with the Pest ? 
on that day luden we die in one . 
he did not leave us ever since then . 
the woman that you killed did , that was not a witch . 
why did you get us volunteer angeschlossen , monk ? 
to God to serve . 
you are God , by killing witches person . 
the woman was already dead . 
I would have them free , if the mob her back ... and verbrannt . 
I got you the suffering erspart . 
sometimes is that all you can still do . 
he said we should go back . 
that where where we wanna go , are they men to savage sad . 
must be the so special you from the cloisters weggelockt did . 
- you want me t tell ? - no . 
you know , what is my job ? 
I' m a Folterer , a Wahrheitserzwinger . 
I' m planning to spend hours with a husband . 
I can smell a lie , and I riech what with you . 
if I were you , I' d move pray . 
- it' s a Gelübde broken ? 
- leave him alone , Mold . 
get back ! 
get back !

- let me alone ! 
- let me see it . 
let me see . 
I want you in on just a minute , will you ?

that' s why did you don' t say ? 
I' m sorry . 
his journey is going to end . 
I beg of Mercy 
- I have a confession ablegen . 
- no , it couldn' to ausbreiten . 
who the hell did you ask me ? 
I' il take you up the confession . 
come on , I erteile you the Absolution . 
you' re finally , the mouth ! 
ego te absolv o a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus . 
I' m sorry . 
our Father in heaven , geheiligt m your name , thy kingdom come . 
thy will be done , like in heaven so on earth . . . . . . our tägliches bread give us today . 
I want to him for a minute be alone . 
I' m glad you could make it . 
goodbye , my friend . 
all right , bury him . 
the forest of Dentwich . 
- how far is it the Moor ? 
- a halber day , maybe less . 
be careful . 
God is behind the Horizont geschlüpft . 
you have tonight Wachdienst , Swire . 
handle the Absolution to teach , has got any guts require . 
you really believe that she' s in the village the dead live again now ? 
I wouldn' t be here if I didn' t dächte . 
did you doubt about it ? 
I think the hunting on Totenbeschwörer and demons are more people and less God . 
in the cloisters eingekuschelt you' ve learned a lot of things . 
demons and Totenbeschwörer re below us . 
you will still know soon . 
now go to sleep .

God has other worry . he' s alright . 
for you now , one of my men dead . 
if we continue , then now . 
how do we know if the man , the we' re looking for , isn' t here ? 
these men are merely life of thieves . 
- you lead us into the Great Moor . 
- I can you not good . 
you will take us there , or you' re staying here alone and il be damned ! 
the village s behind the Moor . 
what' s the plan out ? 
the Ketzer identify him . - catch him in a cage here .
